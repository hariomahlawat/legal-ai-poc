These guards were at first intended to add to the dignity of the Chief Officials as much as for a defensive purpose, and in some cases special restrictions were even placed by treaty on their strength, so as to prevent their acquiring any military importance. Gradually, however, the organization of these guards was improved and from them sprang the Honourable East India Company's European and Indian troops. Both these steadily increased in numbers, until in 1857, it numbered (including local forces and contingents, and a body of 38,000 military police) no less than 3,11,038 officers and men, (Imperial Gazetter of India, 1907, Vol IV (Ch, XI)."}

Summary courts-martial. —The summary court-martial is peculiar to the Indian Army and therefore calls for more detailed notice. These courts were not introduced into the regular Army till after the mutiny of the greater part of the Bengal Army in 1857. The discipline of the regular Indian Army had, for some time before that catastrophe, seriously deteriorated and it was noticed that the irregular troops and more especially the Punjab Irregular Force, were in this respect in a much better state than their comrades of the regular Army. After the suppression of the mutiny the reason for this difference was sought, and. it was found to be largely due to the position of comparative insignificance occupied by the commandant of a regular regiment, who had practically no power to punish or reward his own men. In contrast to this, the commanding officer of a regiment of the Punjab Irregular Force had almost absolute power in that regiment, and could, under the system prevailing in the Force, himself deal promptly and effectively with all military offenders. This system appears to have had its origin in the union, frequent in those days on the Frontier, of the functions of deputy commi"}

This union enabled the commanding officer, as such, to convict and sentence a military offender, and thereafter to issue a warrant for the execution of his sentence which was respected by the civil and prison officials as emanating from him in his civil and magisterial capacity. When a new Indian Army came to be organised on the ruins of the old, it was realised that the hands of the regimental commanding officer must be strengthened if the evils which had led to the practical disappearance of the Bengal Army were to be avoided. With this object summary courts-martial were at first introduced tentatively, and were in 1869 definitely established as part of the legal machinery of the Indian Army. They have proved peculiarly suited to the conditions of that Army and are now the tribunals by far the most frequently utilised in it for the trial of military offenders."}

The jurisdiction of a SCM is dealt with in paras 12 to 14 above. A CO is not ordinarily competent to try by a SCM a charge for any offence specified in AA.s.120(2) without the sanction of the superior authority. He may, however, do so if he considers that there is grave reason for immediate action and reference cannot, without detriment to discipline, be made to the officer empowered to convene a DCM or on active service a SGCM. If he tries without reference such an offence, he must attach an explanatory memorandum to the proceedings (AR.130). In all cases of indecency, fraud or theft (except ordinary theft) and civil offences (except simple assault) and in any case of doubt or difficulty, the charge-sheet and summary of evidence are to be submitted to the DJAG or AJAG of the command before trial is ordered (Regs Army para 458)."}

In the case of aggravated offences which appear to merit a higher punishment than a SCM can award, a GCM or DCM may properly be convened, and it is generally undesirable that a CO should try by SCM a case in which he has a personal interest (AA.s.120). Sanction to try any offence by SCM may, however, legally be given by the proper authority.\nThe officer receiving the application has a duty similar to that of a convening authority of satisfying himself that the charge is properly framed and that the evidence is sufficient to justify trial, and he may direct the CO to alter the charge or to obtain further evidence; in a suitable case, he, may order the release of the accused or the case to be dealt with summarily.

If the accused person pleads guilty, there is no question of fact involved in the trial: but if he does not, he raises two questions or issues —first whether the facts charged against him happened; and next if they did happen, what is their legal consequences. In trials before courts-martial, the members of the courts both find the facts and lay down the law. It is their duty, when applying their minds to questions of fact, to consider themselves bound by the rules of evidence above referred to.

His knowledge of these matters is derived from what is proved to him at the hearing. (But see AA.s.134 and IEA.ss.56 and 57, as to judicial notice). The means of proof, or evidence usually consists of statements made by witnesses under examination, or of documents, produced for inspection, and is, therefore, commonly classified as being either \"oral evidence\" or \"documentary evidence\". But the members of the court may. supplement by direct information the knowledge derived from these sources. Thus, they may inspect for themselves anything sufficiently identified by evidence and produced in court as material to their decision, or they may go to view any place the sight of which may help them to understand the evidence (ARs 82, 128 and 163(1)) and they are also expressly authorised to make use of their general military knowl"}

But in judicial inquiries the information must be on oath or affirmation, and must be liable to be tested by cross-examination, and the Indian Evidence Act (IEA.s.5) by allowing evidence to be given only regarding facts which are \"in issue\" or \"relevant\" excludes particular classes of indirect evidence which an ordinary inquirer would naturally take into consideration.

Thus, if a hand-bill issued by the Government promising a reward and pardon to any accomplice in a certain crime who would confess was brought to the knowledge of an accomplice in the crime, who, under the influence of a hope of a pardon make a confession, that confession would not be voluntary and could not be used at his trial."}

In criminal trials the effect of this is that the burden of proof is, in the first instance, on the prosecutor, or as it is sometimes expressed \"every man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty\". An exception to this rule is that, when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him (IEA.s.106) e.g., in charges for being \"out of bounds\" without a pass, leaving a post without orders, releasing a prisoner without authority, absence without leave etc. In such cases, the main fact being proved, the burden of proving the possession of a pass, leave etc., lies on the accused, and such evidence as the prosecutor may be in a position to give—including inferences from the conduct of the accused—may be accepted as justifying a conviction in the absence of an explanation by the accused."}

On the other hand, where the law imposes upon a person the duty of performing some particular act he is held responsible if he omits to do so. Every person who has charge of another, e.g., a child, a person of unsound mind, an invalid, or a prisoner, is bound to provide him with necessaries if he is so helpless as to be unable to provide himself, and if death results from a neglect of such duty, the person in charge will be responsible unless he can show some good excuse.

Firing with blank ammunition or over the heads of the crowd is strictly forbidden. Rapid fire should never be necessary except in self- defence.

Thus, where there is an actual mutiny or a conspiracy to mutiny, all concerned in the mutiny or conspiracy can be tried under this section for causing or conspiring to cause, or joining in, the mutiny, as the case may be. If no mutiny or conspiracy exists, a person can only be tried under this section if the charge is one of being present at a mutiny not using his utmost endeavours to suppress the same or of failing to inform his commanding or other superior officer of an intent to cause mutiny or such conspiracy or of endeavouring to seduce any person in the forces from his duty or allegiance to the Union."}

So again, on a charge for desertion, the plea \"Guilty, but I intended to return\" amounts to a plea of \"Not guilty\", as the intention not to return is generally an essential element in the offence of desertion.
