## CHAPTER I

### INDIAN MILITARY LAW—ITS ORIGIN AND EXTENT

- (i) Introductory

1.Origin of the Indian Army. —The Indian Army sprang from very small beginnings. Guards were enrolled for the protection of the factories or trading posts which were established by the Honourable East India Company at . Masulipatam, Armagon, , and Balasore in the first half of the seventeenth century. These guards were at first intended to add to the dignity of the Chief Officials as much as for a defensive purpose, and in some cases special restrictions were even placed by treaty on their strength, so as to prevent their acquiring any military importance. Gradually, however, the organization of these guards was improved and from them sprang the Honourable East India Company's European and Indian troops. Both these steadily increased in numbers, until in 1857, it numbered (including local forces and contingents, and a body of 38,000 military police) no less than 3,11,038 officers and men, (Imperial Gazetter of India, 1907, Vol IV (Ch, XI).

2.E.I.,Company's Mutiny Act.—Statutory provision was first made for the discipline of the Honorable East India Company's troops by an Act (27 Geo II, Cap 9) passed in 1754 for "punishing Mutiny and Desertion of officers and soldiers in the service of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies,and for the punishment of offences committed in the East Indies, or at the Island of Saint Helena". Section 8 of this Act empowered the Crown to make Articles of War for the government of these troops, and such articles were accordingly made and published. The terms of the Act were wide enough to cover both European and Indian troops, but the language of the articles themselves showed that they were originally intended for Europeans only. In the absence of any other code, however, the Government of Bengal, , and seem to have applied these articles, with such modification and omissions as appeared necessary, to the bodies of Indian troops maintained by them, of which the present Indian Army is the descendant. In 1813, owing to doubts having arisen as to the legal validity of the existing arrangements for the discipline of the Indian troops, provisions were inserted in the Act (53 Geo III, Cap 155 ss 96 and 97) which was passed in that year to extend the company's privileges for a further term, which legalised the existing system and gave power to each of the Governments of Fort William, Fort Saint George and Bombay to make, laws, regulations, and Articles of War for the government of all Indian officers and soldiers in their respective services. It was further provided in 1824 (4 Geo IV, Cap 81,s 63), that such legislation should apply to the Indian troops of each presidency, wherever serving, and whether within or beyond His Majesty's dominions.

## CHAPTER II

### OUTLINE OF THE ARMY ACT

1.Scheme of chapter. —This Chapter is intended to give a general account of the AA and to show its scope and purpose. Certain explanations of a general character, which would be out of place in the notes to particular sections are also contained in it. For a detailed explanation of the AA reference should however be made to these notes.

2.Subjection to Army Act. —Chapters I and II of the AA are concerned with application of military law and the definition of terms used in the said Act. Persons subject to the AA under clauses (a) to (g) of s.2(1) remain so subject until retired, discharged, released, removed, dismissed or cashiered from the service, those subject under clause (i) thereof remain subject only so long as the conditions contemplated therein continue. The effect of a notification issued under AA.s.6 is that those who rank as officers, junior commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers must, in their relations to military law, be treated in the same way as those who hold corresponding ranks in the Army: for instance a civil official who ranks as an officer can be tried by no military tribunal inferior to a general or summary general court-martial, while one who ranks as a warrant officer can be tried by a district court-martial but cannot be awarded imprisonment or field punishment by it. The status conferred is a personal one and does not give any command over others.

- 3. Definitions. —All the definitions in AA.s.3 must be understood as being subject to the reservation in the opening clause of that section, ie, they are not to be read into the Act if "there is something repugnant in the subject or context". An instance of such a repugnance will be found in AA.s.143. "Officer" in this section cannot be used in the restricted sense indicated in the definition in s.3(xviii), as such a meaning would be repugnant to the context and must therefore be taken in its wider meaning of "Official". It will be noticed that in some cases, terms are defined in AA.s.3 as "meaning" such and such, and in others as "including" some other person or thing. In the former case the term defined is used as a synonym for longer or more cumbrous expression, but the legal effect of the enactment would not be altered if the longer expression were used throughout instead of the shorter. The effect of those definitions or parts of definitions, which declare that a term "includes" something else is somewhat different. Here the result is that wherever the law, as it stands, applies to the class of persons, or things, indicated by the first term, it will also apply to the class or classes who are "included", though the natural meaning of the English language might not indicate that it did apply to the latter. For instance, the expression "non-commissioned officer" does not, as it stands, necessarily cover an acting non-commissioned officer, but the result of the concluding words of definition in AA.s.3(xv) is that, wherever the words "non-commissioned officer" occur in the Act, they are also to be taken as applying to acting non-commissioned officers, and an acting non-com-missioned officer cannot therefore be subjected to imprisonment as a summary award under AA.s.80. Similarly the words "Judge Advocate General", do not as they stand, indicate a "Deputy Judge Advocate General", but the explanation to AA.ss.137 and 138 shows that wherever in that section a power or duty is conferred or imposed on the. Judge Advocate General a similar power or duty is conferred or imposed on each Deputy Judge Advocate General.
4.AA.s.4. —This section enables the provisions of the AA to be applied to any force raised and maintained in under the authority of the Central Government, not being part of the regular Army, and suspend the operation of any other enactment for the time being applicable to the mid force. It also enables the Central Government to specify the authorities who can exercise the powers and duties incident to the operation of the provisions of the AA in respect of such a force. A force to which the AA is thus applied does not thereby become part of the regular Army. By issue of a notification under this section, the provisions of the AA have been applied to Civilian General Transport Companies, Assam Rifles and GREF.

5.AA.s.8. —The powers conferred by the AA on the Commanders of armies, army corps, divisions and brigades are, in the first instance, restricted to the officers holding such commands. This section, however, provides for the grant of powers to officers commanding military organizations, not specifically mentioned in the Act, which, in the opinion of the Central Government, are not less than a brigade. The Central Government by issue of a notification under this section. may prescribe the officer by whom the powers which under the AA may be exercised by officers commanding armies, army corps, divisions and brigades, as regards persons serving in such military organizations. Cases can thus be provided for as they arise and in accordance with local circumstances, without the necessity for fresh legislative action to meet every new development.

6.Enrolment and Attestation.—Everyone who is permanently subject to military law (except officers, junior commissioned and warrant officers) is subject to that law by virtue of his "Enrolment". This process and the subsequent attestation of certain enrolled persons, is described in Chapter III of the AA and in the Rules made by the Central Government under the powers therein conferred. The principle underlying these provisions is that no person should be permanently subjected to an exceptional and severe code, like that contained in the AA, without a definite act on his part, such act being susceptible of easy proof. "Enrolment" is therefore made a definite act recorded in a formal document, the enrolment paper, which is itself made legal evidence of the facts stated in it (AA.s, 141) and which shows clearly all the conditions of the bargain which the enrolled person has made with the State, Attestation is an act of administration to the enrolled person, the oath or affirmation of military fidelity. It forms no part of the process of enrolment and this oath or affirmation is administered to combatants, other persons selected to hold non-commissioned or acting non-commissioned ranks and persons subject to the AA as prescribed by the Central Government. The ceremony takes place when the candidate is fit for duty or has completed a prescribed period of probation and confers on the person admitted to it a certain status and the privilege of not being ordinarily discharge able without reference, at least, to his Brigade Commander. (AR.13 and table annexed thereto). Only attested persons can rise to non-commissioned ranks in the regular Army. The enrolment paper referred to above contains an official record of the bargain made with the enrolled person on behalf of the State, and the conditions of that bargain cannot be altered except with the consent of the person concerned. An instance of such consent is when a man, on being trained in special duties, agrees to serve for longer than the term for which he was originally engaged. Such a variation of the conditions of service is therefore recorded on the man's enrolment paper and signed by him. No separate attestation document is required for the classes who are attested. The fact of attestation is in each case recorded on the enrolment paper and authenticated by the signature of the attesting officer.

- 7. Dismissal & Discharge etc. —(i) Officers. —No authority has been prescribed under AA.s.22 as a competent authority to authorise the discharge of officers. The officers receive their commission from the President who authorises their retirement from the service on resignation of commission (See Regs Army para 103). They may also be dismissed or removed by order of the Central Government under AA.s.19, on grounds of failure to qualify at an examination or course, misconduct, inefficiency or disability (ARs 13A, 14, 15 & 15A), the dismissal or removal taking effect as provided in AR.18. They may be cashiered or dismissed by sentence of court-martial, the cashiering or dismissal taking effect as provided in AR.168. They remain subject to the AA until duly retired, cashiered, removed or dismissed from the service.
- (ii) JCOs, WOs and OR—Dismissal, removal or discharge of JCOs, WOs and other enrolled persons is provided in AA.ss.20 and 22 and ARs.13 and 17, the dismissal, removal or discharge taking effect as provided in AR.18. They can also be dismissed by sentence of a court-martial, the dismissal taking effect as provided in AR.168. They remain subject to the AA until duly dismissed, removed or discharged from service. The principal points to be noticed are that—
(a) Dismissal,removal or discharge in every case must be authorised by competent authority as provided in the AA and Rules.

(b)Dismissal, removal or discharge takes effect as provided in ARs.18 or 168, as the case may be.

(c)In no case dismissal, removal or discharge can be made retrospective. AR.18(3).

(d)A valid dismissal or discharge, which has taken effect, cannot subsequently be cancelled without the consent of the person concerned. AR.11(2).

(e)The discharge of a person entitled under the conditions of his enrolment to be discharged, must be carried out with all convenient speed i.e. without unreasonable delay.

(f) Dismissal under existing regulations involves the loss of any pension or gratuity which the dismissed person may have earned; and

(g) Every JCO, WO or enrolled person who is dismissed, removed, discharged, retired or released from service must be furnished by his with a discharge certificate as provided in AA.s.23, on the date, if possible, from which the dismissal or discharge takes effect.

- 8. Summary reduction etc. —AA.s.20(2), (4) and (6) provide for the summary reduction of WOs and NCOs. A WO reduced to the ranks cannot however, be required to serve in the ranks as a sepoy. Such administrative reduction may be ordered if the WO or NCO is found inefficient or unfit to hold the position in which he was placed. Such reduction should not, however, be ordered on grounds of misconduct, but the person should be charged for the same and brought to trial. An acting NCO may be ordered by his CO to revert from his acting or lance rank to his permanent grade. Such reduction may, in each case, be ordered under AA.s.20 (6) if the acting NCO has been found unsuited to the position in which he was placed. Reduction of WOs and NCOs can also be ordered by the sentence of a court martial as provided in AA.s.71(f). A WO sentenced to reduction to the ranks by a sentence of a court-martial, however, will not be required to serve in ranks as a sepoy. A CO may also deprive an acting NCO of his acting or lance rank as a summary award under AA.s.80(e).

- 9. Restrictions on fundamental rights. —AA.s.21 provides for the restrictions of certain fundamental rights which are conferred on every citizen under Part III of the Constitution. These restrictions are contained in AA.s.21 and ARs 19 to 21. Under the said rules, the fundamental rights to form associations or unions and of speech and expression and assembly are abrogated. These rights have been abrogated because of the nature of duties performed by members of the regular Army and for the maintenance of discipline among them.

- 10. Offences. —Chapter VI of the AA classifies ungrouped together and the groups have, as regards military offences, been arranged in such an order as to emphasize their relative military importance. It must be remembered that Chapter IV of the Indian Penal Code (General Exceptions) applies to offences under special laws, such as the AA.(IPC.s.40). The definitions of these offences in AA must, therefore, be read as subject to the "general exceptions". Thus, if a non-commissioned officer charged under AA.s.47 with striking a sepoy proves that he, only, did so in the exercise of his right of private defence, he will be entitled to an acquittal (IPC.s.96). Similarly, if a person charged with any offence under the AA is proved to have committed the offence while incapable, by reason of insanity or involuntary intoxication, of knowing the nature of his act, or that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law, he is entitled to the benefit of IPC.ss.84 or 85, as the case may be and cannot be punished for what he has done.

11.Scale of punishments. —Having laid down the offences, AA.ss.71 to 75 provide a scale of punishments which can be awarded by courts-martial to persons subject to the AA. For each offence, with the exception of civil offences under AA.s.69(a) for which an obligatory punishment is provided (e.g.,death or imprisonment for life for murder), the AA provides that the court, subject of course, to the limits imposed by the said Act upon its powers (AA.ss.119 and 120), may award a specified (maximum) punishment or "such less punishment as is mentioned in the Act" i.e., as in accordance with the scale laid down. If, for example, the maximum punishment assigned to the offence is imprisonment, any other punishment lower in the scale and appropriate with the rank of the offender can be awarded in its place, A maximum punishment is only intended to be imposed when the offence committed is the worst of its class, or is committed by a habitual offender, or is- committed in circumstances which require an example to be made. An important distinction is made by the AA in that certain offences are punishable more severely when committed in time of war or on active service than at other times. Instances of this distinction will be found in AA.ss.34, 36, 38, 40 and 41. A (sentry, for example, found asleep on his post or who quits his post without being regularly relieved in time of war, would, if the character and circumstances of the offence were sufficiently grave, be liable to suffer death, while in time of peace he could at the utmost be sentenced to imprisonment.

- 12. Combination of punishments. —Under AA.s.73, two or more punishments applicable to the rank of the offender may be awarded in combination. Thus, an officer, JCO, WO or NCO sentenced to forfeiture of seniority of rank may also be sentenced to severe reprimand or reprimand and to stoppages; or a JCO, WO or other enrolled person sentenced to imprisonment may also be dismissed from the service,, and to forfeit all arrears of pay and allowances etc., due to him and to stoppages. An officer sentenced to imprisonment must also be sentenced to be cashiered (AA.s.74). A WO or NCO sentenced by a court-martial to imprisonment for life or imprisonment, dismissal or field punishment, is deemed to be reduced to the ranks even if a, sentence of reduction is not specifically awarded by the court (AA.s.77).

- 13. Field punishment, —AA.s.75 provides that a person subject to the AA, under the rank of a WO, committing any offence on active service may on conviction by court-martial be awarded field punishment. ARs 172 to 176 prescribe the types of field punishments, their extent and the mode of their execution.

- 14. Summary punishments. —AA.s.80 provides for the award of one or more of the punishments specified in the section summarily by a CO to persons subject to the AA other than officers, JCOs or WOs, within the limits imposed by AA.s.81 and the extent prescribed in AR.192. A CO can also summarily try, under AA.s.85, a JCO charged with an offence and award him stoppages of pay and allowances until any proved loss or damage occasioned by the offence is made good.

- 15. Collective fines. —AA.s.89 permits imposition of collective fines for the purpose of enforcing collective responsibility for losses of arms. Experience has shown that such responsibility is the best safeguard for the security of the arms of a company or similar unit. The amount and incidence of fines to be levied and the procedure to be observed in such cases, are regulated by ARs 185 and 186 (AA.s.191(2)(b)). Except as provided in AA.s.89, penal deductions can be imposed only on individuals and not collectively. Where, therefore, the loss of arms is occasioned by some wilful act which can be brought home to an individual or individuals, the case should be dealt with summarily or by court-martial and stoppages awarded to make good such loss (AA.ss,90(d) and 91(e)). Under AA.s.89 fine cannot be imposed on officers but only on JCOs, WOs, NCOs and men of the company or equivalent unit concerned.

- 16. Penal deductions. —The pay of a person subject to AA is protected as provided in AA.s.25. A person subject to the AA is, therefore, entitled to receive his pay without any deductions other than such deductions as may be authorized by proper authority under the said Act. Allowances, however, are not so protected. AA.ss.90 and 91 lay down the circumstances under which penal deductions may be made from the pay and allowances of a person subject to the AA; Pay and Allowances Regulations, Part I provide for the cases in which pay and allowances are to be forfeited within the limits of the said sections and no discretion is given to the CO whether or not to enforce wholly or partially the forfeiture.
Other deductions which are not "penal" may be made from the pay and allowances of a person subject to the AA to meet public claims or regimental claims or debts or any sum required to meet compulsory contribution to any provident or benevolent fund or other fund approved by the Central Government, as provided in AR.205. The said rule, in effect, provides a convenient and expeditious method of enforcing such claims and recovering such debts without recourse to the civil courts.

an officer, JCO, WO or NCO sentenced to forfeiture of seniority of rank may also be sentenced to severe reprimand or reprimand and to stoppages; or a JCO, WO or other enrolled person sentenced to imprisonment may also be dismissed from the service,, and to forfeit all arrears of pay and allowances etc., due to him and to stoppages. An officer sentenced to imprisonment must also be sentenced to be cashiered (AA.s.74). A WO or NCO sentenced by a court-martial to imprisonmen

A "penal" deduction is, in principle, a deduction made as a penalty for an offence of which an accused has been convicted and constitutes part or the whole of his punishment. The term has, however, acquired a somewhat specialized meaning and every deduction which is authorised in AA.ss.90 and 91 must be understood to be "penal" irrespective of the common use of that word. AAs.95 allows penal deductions to be made also from any public money due to a person subject to AA, other than a pension and AA.s.97 provides for the remission of such deductions.

### COURTS-MARTIAL

17.Arrests and proceedings before trial. —Chapter IX of the A A provides for the arrest of military offenders by military and civil authorities (AA.ss.101,104, 105, and 107). The said chapter also contains provisions to ensure that a military offender is not detained in custody indefinitely without the charge against him being investigated by his CO or without being brought to trial by court-martial (AA.ss.102 and 103). AR.27 provides for the manner in which such a military offender may be detained in custody, where necessary, pending his trial by court-martial.

18.Court-martial. —Chapters X, XI and XII of the AA (AA.ss.108 to 165) contain the principal provisions governing the convening, composition, procedure, revision and confirmation of courts-martial and certain provisions relating to jurisdiction of courts-martial and evidence. The remainder of the law pertaining to these matters is contained in ARs.37 to 165.

19.Description of courts-martial. —There are four different kinds of courts- martial as under: —

(a)General courts-martial;

(b) District Courts-martial;

(c) Summary General-courts-martial; and

(d) Summary Courts-martial.

- 20. Summary courts-martial. —The summary court-martial is peculiar to the Indian Army and therefore calls for more detailed notice. These courts were not introduced into the regular Army till after the mutiny of the greater part of the Bengal Army in 1857. The discipline of the regular Indian Army had, for some time before that catastrophe, seriously deteriorated and it was noticed that the irregular troops and more especially the Punjab Irregular Force, were in this respect in a much better state than their comrades of the regular Army. After the suppression of the mutiny the reason for this difference was sought, and. it was found to be largely due to the position of comparative insignificance occupied by the commandant of a regular regiment, who had practically no power to punish or reward his own men. In contrast to this, the commanding officer of a regiment of the Punjab Irregular Force had almost absolute power in that regiment, and could, under the system prevailing in the Force, himself deal promptly and effectively with all military offenders. This system appears to have had its origin in the union, frequent in those days on the Frontier, of the functions of deputy commissioner, political officer and military commandant, in one and the same person. This union enabled the commanding officer, as such, to convict and sentence a military offender, and thereafter to issue a warrant for the execution of his sentence which was respected by the civil and prison officials as emanating from him in his civil and magisterial capacity. When a new Indian Army came to be organised on the ruins of the old, it was realised that the hands of the regimental commanding officer must be strengthened if the evils which had led to the practical disappearance of the Bengal Army were to be avoided. With this object summary courts-martial were at first introduced tentatively, and were in 1869 definitely established as part of the legal machinery of the Indian Army. They have proved peculiarly suited to the conditions of that Army and are now the tribunals by far the most frequently utilised in it for the trial of military offenders.

- 21. Execution of sentences. —Chapter XIII of the AA provides for the execution of sentences which have been duly passed and, where necessary confirmed. The Prisoners Act, 1900 (Act III of 1900) renders unnecessary the elaborate provisions as to the execution of sentences of imprisonment for life or imprisonment. All that is now required in ordinary cases, is to arrange for the transmission of military convicts and prisoners to civil prisons, after which the above mentioned Act provides for their discipline and, when necessary, their transfer to other such prisons or to convict establishments. Forms of committal warrants under AA.ss.168, 169, 170, 171 and 173 are provided in Appendix IV Part II and Appendix V to AR (see ARs.166, 167 and 169 to 171). The warrants issued under AA.s.173 brings the change regarding setting aside of the proceeding's, remission or mitigation of sentence as it affects the prisoner, to the official notice of the superintendent of the civil prison where he is confined, and provides for his release or the modification of the punishment to be inflicted upon him. There are several forms of warrant for use in different circumstances, and particular attention should therefore be paid by officers using them to the notes to the aforesaid sections where the proper warrant to be used in each case is clearly indicated. The use of wrong form of warrant might have serious consequences. When an offender whose sentence has been under suspension is subsequently committed on that sentence, by reason of its having been either specifically or automatically along with another sentence under AA.s.188(b) ordered into execution, particular care should be taken in the preparation of the warrant, which should show exactly what is the unexpired balance of the sentence on which the offender is committed.

- 22. Suspension of sentence of imprisonment. —AA.s.182 provides that when a person subject to the AA is sentenced by a court-martial to imprisonment for life or imprisonment, the Central Government, COAS or any officer empowered to convene a GCM or SGCM may suspend the sentence. Where necessary such authority, while a sentence is suspended, may order that the offender be committed to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence or remit the sentence (AA.s,186). Where dismissal is awarded in addition to the sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment and where the sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment is suspended, dismissal does not take effect until so ordered by any of the authorities specified in AA.s.182 (AA.s.190(1)). Where the suspended sentence is remitted, dismissal, if any. is also to be remitted (AA.s.190(2)).
If an offender under a suspended sentence is again sentenced to imprisonment for three months or more and such sentence is not suspended, he is required to be committed for the unexpired portion of the previous sentence (AA.s.188(b)).

The provisions regarding suspension of sentence do not apply to officers (see notes to AA.s.190). They should be resorted to in appropriate cases in respect of others subject to the AA.

When a person subject to the AA is to be dismissed or discharged otherwise than by a sentence of a court-martial, before ordering such dismissal or discharge the fact whether there is a suspended sentence on which the individual concerned has not been committed, should be taken note of.

23.Other provisions.-The remaining chapters of the AA deal with pardons and remissions, Statutory Rules and miscellaneous subjects, one of which is the disposal of property or documents produced before courts-martial or in their custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed or which have been used for the commission of any offence. The court, the confirming officer or any authority superior to that officer may under the provisions of AA.ss.150 and 151 make certain orders on this subject. These chapters call for no special remarks in addition to those which will be found in the notes appended to the respective sections.

## CHAPTER III

### ARREST: —INVESTIGATION OF CHARGES

- (i) Arrest
- 1. Military custody of person charged with offence. - A person subject to AA, who is charged with an offence, may be taken into military custody (AA.ss.3(XIII), 101(1) and Regs Army para 391) in accordance with the following provisions (AA.s.101(2)): -
(a) Any such person may be ordered into military custody by any superior officer. (AA.s.3(XXIII)).

(b) An officer may order into military custody any officer, though he may be of a higher rank, engaged in a quarrel, affray or disorder.

(c) A provost-marshal (AA.ss.3(XX) and 107(4)), which term includes any of his deputies, assistants or any other person legally exercising authority under him or on his behalf, or a provost-marshal appointed under the Naval or Air Force Law or any person legally exercising authority under him or on his behalf, may arrest and detain for trial any person subject to AA who commits or is charged with an offence, but an officer cannot be arrested otherwise than on the order of another officer (AA.s.107(3)

(d)A police officer or magistrate may arrest, within his jurisdiction, a person subject to AA who is accused of an offence under the said Act or who is a deserter, on a written request in that behalf of the Commanding officer of such a person (AA.ss.104 & 105(1)).

(e) Any police officer may arrest without warrant a person reasonably believed to be subject to AA and to be a deserter or traveling without authority (AA.s.105(2)).

Military custody means the arrest or confinement of a person according to the usages of the service (AA.s.3(XIII)) but such a course is by no means obligatory; if the offence is not serious it may be investigated and disposed of without placing the offender under arrest. The arrest of an offender is governed by the following factors:-

(a) that he may not abscond and be available to stand his trial:

(b) that he may not do harm to himself;

(c) that he may not tamper with the prosecution evidence or witnesses; and

(d) that the offence involved is serious or the ends of discipline require an immediate arrest to make an example of the offender.

- 2. Nature of arrest—officers. -In the case of an officer, custody means ''arrest"—either open or close: but, if circumstances require it, he may be placed under the charge of a guard, piquet, patrol, sentry or provost marshal. Whether the arrest is open or close will depend upon the direction of the officer who ordered it. An officer in close arrest is placed in charge of an "escort" consisting of another (if possible, a senior) officer of the same rank. He must not leave his quarters or tent except to take such exercise under supervision as the medical officer thinks necessary. An officer in open arrest may take exercise at stated periods within certain limits, which are usually the precincts of the regimental lines or camp; he must not, however, appear out of uniform, or at any place of amusement or public resort, nor must he wear sash, sword, belt, or spurs. An officer placed under arrest should always be informed in writing of the nature of the arrest, which will be governed by the circumstances of the case; and any change in the nature of the arrest should be notified in writing to him. An officer (or other person) under arrest may be ordered or permitted to attend as a witness before a court-martial, or before a civil court, or to leave his station for some special purpose.

- 3. Arrest when ordered. —As a rule, a commanding officer will not place an officer under arrest without investigation of the complaint or the circumstances tending to criminate him; though cases may occur in which it would be necessary to do so. He should always place under arrest an officer against whom he decides to prefer a charge, and it is his duty to report each case of arrest without unnecessary delay to the proper superior authority. (AA.s.102(2) & AR 27(1)).

- 4. Arrest, how ordered. —An officer is put in arrest either directly by the officer who orders it, or, more generally, by some subordinate carrying out his orders, i.e., by the adjutant of the unit when the arrest is ordered by the commanding officer, and. by an officer of the staff when the arrest is ordered by a superior officer, and not through the channel of the commanding officer. The order may be verbal or written, the latter as being more formal being the preferable method,except where the offence is committed actually in the presence of the commanding officer or superior officer. On being put in arrest, an officer is deprived of his sword.

- 5. Release from arrest. —The release of an officer under arrest may be ordered by the officer who imposed the arrest, or the superior to whom it may have been reported; but, as a rule, except in cases of obvious error, the release should not be ordered without the sanction of the highest authority to whom the case may have been referred. (RegsArmypara394). An officer released, except specifically without prejudice to re-arrest, will not again be arrested on the same charge unless some new and special circumstances have arisen.

- 6. Junior commissioned, warrant and non-commissioned officers. —The rules which govern the custody of officers apply also to a junior commissioned, warrant or non-commissioned officer. If charged with a serious offence, a junior commissioned, warrant or non-commissioned officer will, as a rule, be placed under arrest forthwith; but in case of doubt as to the commission of the offence, the arrest may be delayed; and if the offence is not serious, it may be disposed of without previous arrest.
Persons subject to the AA under s.2(l)(i) as officers, junior commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers may, when charged with an offence, be placed under arrest under the same conditions as persons holding these ranks.

7.Other persons. —A person under the rank of non-commissioned officer taken into military custody on a charge of having committed an offence is placed either under close arrest or under open arrest. Close arrest in the case of such a person means confinement in charge of a guard, piquet, patrol, sentry or provost marshal. He is not to be placed in close arrest unless confinement is necessary for his safe custody or the maintenance of discipline. For minor offences, such as absence from roll calls and other slight irregularities men are placed under open arrest. A person under open arrest will not quit the regimental lines, except on duty or with special permission, until his case is disposed of (RegsArmypara395(e)), but he will attend parades and may be ordered to perform all duties. (Regs Army para 396 (c)).

8.Performance of duties while in closed arrest.—An officer, junior commissioned officer or warrant officer under arrest will not perform any duty other than personal routine duties and such duties as may be necessary to relieve him from the charge of any cash, equipment, stores, accounts or office of which he may have charge or for which he may be responsible. (Regs Army para 396 (a)).

Except on active service, a NCO under arrest or a sepoy under close arrest, is not to be required to perform any duty other than personal routine duties and such as may be necessary to relieve him from the care of any cash, stores, etc, for which he is responsible, nor is he permitted to bear arms, except in an emergency by order of his commanding officer, or on the line of march. (Regs Army para 396(b)). If, however, by error, he is ordered to perform any duty, his offence is not thereby condoned. (RegsArmypara396(e)).

9.No right to demand trial. —Except in the circumstances mentioned in AA.s.84(a) when it is proposed to award summarily to an officer, junior commissioned or warrant officer, a punishment of forfeiture of seniority or of service for the purpose of promotion, a person subject to the AA has no right to demand a court-martial. If he deems himself wronged by the arrest, or otherwise, his remedy is a complaint in the manner prescribed by the AA. (AA.ss.26 and 27).

Every officer whose character or conduct as an officer and gentleman has been impugned or who has been charged or arraigned before a civil (criminal) court, may be suspended from duty, in which case he will be placed under the same restrictions as an officer in open arrest and may be permitted to wear plain clothes, (Regs Army para 346).

- (ii) Investigation of Charges

10.The charge against every person taken into military custody must be investigated without unnecessary delay (AA.s.102(I)). The commanding officer of the accused is responsible that the investigation is begun within forty-eight hours of the committal of the person being reported to him unless investigation within that period seems to him to be impracticable with due regard to the public service. Every case of a person being detained in custody beyond forty-eight hours, and the reasons for the delay in disposing of the case, must be reported to superior authority. (AA.s.102(2), AR.27(1)).

11.In the case of an officer. There is some difference in procedure between the cases of officers and of other persons. In all cases the commanding officer is made responsible for deciding whether the charge ought to be dismissed or proceeded with, and in the latter event for taking the further necessary steps: but in the case of an officer there need not, unless the officer, requires it, be a formal examination of witnesses and a recording of their evidence in the presence of the accused. If he likes, he can waive such formal investigation (AR.25); at the same time the commanding officer may hold one at his discretion.

12.ln the case of other persons. Prior to the appearance before the commanding officer of an alleged offender, a preliminary investigation into his case is generally made by his squadron or company commander, or by the corresponding officer in other branches of the service. If the accused is not in arrest or confinement, or the case is not one which the commanding officer has reserved for his own disposal this officer may decide to deal with the case himself by awarding one of the minor punishments within his power or by dismissing it. Every case in which the accused is in arrest or confinement is dealt with by the commanding officer, unless the latter remands it to the squadron or company commander for disposal. AR.22 applies to this preliminary investigation equally with that before the commanding officer.

13.Duty of officer conducting investigation.-The manner in which the investigation of charges by a commanding officer is to be carried out is regulated by ARs.22 to 25. This duty requires deliberation and the exercise of temper and judgment, in the interest alike of discipline and of justice to the accused. Except in case of officers, the investigation must be conducted in the presence of the accused. ARs.22(1) and 25.

After the nature of the offence charged has been made known to the accused, the witnesses present on the spot who depose to the facts on which the charge is based are examined. The accused must have full liberty of cross-examination. The commanding officer, after hearing what is stated against the accused will, if he is of opinion that no offence at all, or no offence requiring notice, has been made out, at once dismiss the charge (AR.22(2)). Otherwise, he must ask the accused what he has to say in his defence, and whether he has any witnesses to call, and will give him full opportunity both of making a statement and of supporting it by evidence. The commanding officer will then consider whether to dismiss the case, or to deal summarily with it himself, or, if the accused is below the rank of warrant officer, to order trial by summary court-martial, or to adjourn the case for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to writing, with a view to trial by court-martial, or when the accused is an officer below the rank of lieutenant colonel, or is a junior commissioned or a warrant officer lore summary disposal under AA.ss.83 and 84 (AR.22(3)). He cannot forthwith hold a. summary court-martial, unless the offence is one which a commanding officer can try without reference to superior authority, or, if the offence is one requiring such reference, he certifies that there is grave reason for immediate action and that such reference cannot be made without detriment to discipline. (AAs.120(2), AR 130). A summary of evidence and charge sheet must accompany all references to superior authority.

14.Caution as to expressing opinion. —During the investigation, the officer conducting it must be careful not to let fall, before he disposes of the case, any expression of opinion as to the guilt of the accused, or one which might prejudice him at a subsequent trial. It may happen that officers who have been present at the investigation are detailed as members of the court convened in consequence of it; therefore, nothing should be said or done which might, though unconsciously, bias their judgment beforehand. Conduct sheets should be examined by the commanding officer when, and not before, he has satisfied himself as to the guilt of the accused.

- 15. Adjournment for taking a summary of evidence.- Where a commanding officer adjourns the case for the purpose of having the evidence reduced to writing the evidence of all material witnesses (whether called before the commanding officer or not) must be taken down in writing before the commanding officer or (as is usually the case) before some officer deputed by him, in the presence of the accused, who must be allowed to cross-examine them. (AR.23(1) and (2)). The commanding officer can, if necessary, issue a summon requiring the attendance of a civilian witness.(AR.23.(6)). The witnesses cannot be sworn or affirmed. In certain cases a signed statement of evidence may be accepted -e.g. where the attendance of witness cannot be readily procured. In such a case the officer taking the summary must certify the reason for accepting a written statement. (AR.23(5))..
When all the evidence for the prosecution has been taken, the accused, before he makes any statement, must be formally cautioned in the prescribed words. (AR.23(3)). Any statement of the accused will be taken down, but he will not be cross-examined upon it.

16.Mode of taking summary.-Great care is necessary in taking a summary of evidence. The discrepancies not infrequently observable between the statements recorded in the summary of evidence and the evidence given before a court-martial may often be traced rather to the hasty or careless preparation of the summary than to any prevarication or desire to mislead on the part of the witnesses. Moreover, a carelessly prepared summary of evidence may require references between the convening officer and the commanding officer of the accused and be a cause of delay in bringing the accused to trial.

17.Remand of accused for trial by court-martial.-When the summary of evidence has been taken, the commanding officer must consider it and finally determine whether or not to remand the accused for trial by court-martial (AR.24). It may be that on reading the evidence he will come to the conclusion that the case is one which ought to be disposed of summarily, or even dismissed. If a court-martial is ordered or applied for, it is a matter for discretion whether the accused need be kept in arrest or confinement unlit the charge is disposed of. It is the duty of the commanding officer on reading the summary of evidence to note whether or not the evidence taken down in the summary corresponds with the evidence given at the inquiry before him. If the commanding officer decides to remand the accused for trial by court-martial, he must next consider by what class of court he should be tried. As a rule this will be a summary court-martial, sanction being previously obtained where such sanction is necessary. (AA.s.120(2)). When applying for a general or district court-martial or for sanction to hold a summary court-martial, the summary of evidence and charge-sheet should be submitted with the application.

18.Use of summary of evidence.- The summary of evidence may be used for certain limited purposes at the trial, and also for the purpose of giving notice to the accused of the charge he will have to meet, and to the convening officer, presiding officer and judge-advocate (if any) of the case to be tried. Either the summary itself or a copy must be laid before the court-martial. (AR.41).

- (iii) Summary Powers of a Commanding Officer

19.Powers of commanding officer. —AA.s.82 authorises Chief of the Army Staff to specify the minor punishments which may be awarded summarily to persons subject to the Act; and AA.s.80 authorises him to specify the officers by whom such punishments may be awarded. The minor punishments specified under this section set out and, for the purpose of awarding such punishments, the officers are specified in the Regs Army para.443.

There is no offence which a commanding officer is compelled by law or by rules to send before a court-martial, and each case should be considered on its merits, but a commanding officer should not, of course, dispose summarily of case which he is debarred by AA.s.120(2) from trying by summary court-martial without reference to the superior authority, or any other case which obviously deserves a more severe punishment than he is empowered to award summarily.

A commanding officer has no power to punish an officer but the custom of the service allows a commanding officer or any superior officer to reprove an officer for a minor breach of discipline not sufficiently serious to justify its being made the subject of a charge under the AA and brought to trial before a court--martial, or tor summary disposal by a superior authority under AA.s.83 or 84. Such a reproof is not a punishment, but in certain circumstances it might debar a charge from being subsequently laid against the officer. COs should therefore be careful not to administer such a reproof in cases where superior authority might wish to take stronger disciplinary action.

- 20. No trial after punishment by commanding officer-. When once an offender has been punished or the charge otherwise disposed of by his CO or some other officer, he cannot be tried by court martial for the same offence, and similarly he cannot be subjected to a minor punishment, for any offence of which he has been acquitted or convicted by a court martial or a criminal court (AA. s.121).
When commanding officer has once awarded punishment, he cannot afterwards increase it. It is considered that his award is complete when the man has left his presence (See note7to AA.s.80).

- 21. Summary awards by superior authority-Officers below the rank of lieutenant colonel, JCOs and WOs may be summarily dealt with by one of the superior authorities specified in AA.ss.83 and 84. Such officers, JCOs and WOs may be subjected to one or more of the following punishments—forfeiture of seniority or forfeiture of service for promotion (in the case of those whose promotion depends on length of service) for a period not exceeding twelve months, severe reprimand, or reprimand and stoppages. A CO is only authorised to award ctoppages to a JCO (AA.s.85.). Awards which appear to be illegal or excessive can be reviewed by superior authority as provided in AA.ss.87 and 88. (Regs Army para.442, also refers).

- 22. Hearing of charge.—When an officer, JCO or WO is remanded for summary disposal of a charge against him by superior authority a copy of the summary of evidence or (in the case of an officer where there is no summary of evidence) an abstract of evidence should be given to him not less than 24 hours before the trial (AR 26(1)).
The authority empowered to deal summarily with the charge must, unless he dismisses the charge, or unless the accused has consented in writing to dispense with the attendance of witnesses, hear the evidence in the presence of the accused, who will be given full opportunity to cross-examine any witness against him, and to call any witnesses and to make a statement in his defence. If the accused consents in writing, the above authority may deal with the case summarily after reading the summary or abstract of evidence. (AR.26(2)). Evidence given before a court of inquiry is not admissible, and cannot be used as a summary or abstract of evidence, even with the consent of the accused (AR 182).

- 23. Disposal of charges.—An authority can dispose of a case summarily, not only if asked to do so, but also if he is asked to convene a court martial for the trial of the offender, Even if he is asked to deal summarily with the case, he can, if he thinks it desirable, convene a court martial. (Regs Army para.449). If on perusal of the summary (or abstract) of evidence and other documents he thinks fit, he can at once, without bringing the accused before him, either order the charge to be dismissed or order a court martial, or he can decide to hear the evidence with a view to dealing summarily with the case. After hearing the evidence, the" authority can still order dismissal of the charge or order a court martial, or he can deal summarily with it, but, if he proposes to award a punishment of forfeiture of seniority or service for promotion, the accused has the right to elect trial by court martial (AA.s.84.(a)).

- 24. Right of appeal from summary award. —There is no appeal from a summary award but as has been already mentioned, an officer, JCO or WO may instead of submitting to a summary award of forfeiture of seniority or service for the purpose of promotion, elect to be tried by court martial. Other persons cannot demand a court martial; but if any person considers himself wronged by the award he may make a complaint in the manner prescribed in AA.ss.26 and 27. A punishment awarded by a CO under AA.s.80, which appears to be wholly or partly illegal, unjust or excessive or too severe, can be cancelled, varied, or remitted by certain superior officers. (Regs Army para 442).

- 25. Penal deductions and remissions (Stoppage's from; pay and allowances). — Under AA.s.91, and Pay and Allowances, Regulations, a person subject to the AA, other than an officer, forfeits pay and allowances automatically for every day of desertion, or absence without leave, or as a prisoner of war; also for every day of imprisonment or field punishment awarded by a criminal court, court martial or an officer exercising authority under AA.s.80 or in custody under any charge resulting in a conviction by a criminal court or court-martial, or under a charge of absence without leave, resulting in a summary award of imprisonment or field punishment under AA.s.80; also for every day in hospital on account of sickness certified to have been caused by an offence committed by him.
Under AA.s.97 and AR.195. —(a) Any forfeiture of pay and allowances under chapter VIII of the AA may be remitted by the Central Government; (b) on summary conviction for absence without leave for a period not exceeding five days, the CO may remit the forfeiture of pay and allowances entitled by that absence; and (c) the forfeiture of pay and allowances incurred by a prisoner of war may be remitted by the prescribed authority unless a court of inquiry finds that the absence was due to the man's own fault or misconduct. Pay and allowances Regulations only authorise forfeiture of pay and allowances under clause (b) of AA.s.91 for any period the offender may have been in confinement; a JCO, WO and NCO in arrest (not confinement) and a person in open arrest, incurs no forfeiture of pay and allowances under this clause.

In the case of absence without leave, as pay and allowances are forfeited automatically, the officer dealing with the case should make no award as to it, but merely inform the offender of the number of days pay and allowances forfeited. If a period of absence does not amount to six hours or upwards, no pay and allowances are forfeited, except where the absence prevents the absentee from fulfilling some military duty, which is thereby thrown on some other person, in which case the absentee will forfeit a day's pay and allowances no matter how short his absence may be. If the period of absence amounts to six hours, but not to twelve hours, one day's pay and allowances are forfeited. If the period of absence amounts to twelve hours or upwards, pay and allowances are forfeited for the whole of each clay during any portion of which the man was absent. (AA.s.92).

A CO may, where a man is not tried by court martial, order stoppages of his pay and allowances to make compensation for any expenses caused by him, or for any loss or damage or destruction done by him to any arms, ammunition, equipment, clothing, instruments, or regimental necessaries or military decoration, or to any buildings or property; and may likewise order the stoppage of the amount of any forfeiture or fine awarded by himself.

## CHAPTER IV

### COURTS-MARTIAL

- (i) Description of courts-martial and How Convened

1.Description of courts-martial. —A person subject to the AA who is to be tried by court-martial may be brought before a GCM, a DCM, or a SCM. In certain circumstances trial may be by a SGCM

The SCM is the tribunal most frequently used in the Army and is specially dealt with in paras 102 to 113 of this chapter.

- 2. Distinction between DCM and GCM, —The difference between a DCM and a GCM consists mainly in their composition and in the extent of punishment which each tribunal can award.

3.Order convening the court. —A DCM or GCM depends for its jurisdiction upon the order which brings it into being, namely the convening order issued by an officer authorised under the AA so to do.

4.Convening of a GCM. —A GCM may be convened by the Central Government or the COAS or by an officer empowered in this behalf by warrant of the COAS (AA.s.109).

5.Convening of a DCM. —A DCM may be convened by an officer having power to convene a GCM or by an officer empowered in this behalf by warrant of any such officer (AA.s.110).

6.Form of warrants. —The forms of various courts-martial warrants at present in use are set out in part IV. They are the following: —

- (i) A-1 warrants—Issued by the COAS to Officers Commanding Army. Army Corps, division, independent brigade or equivalent commanders authorising them to convene GCM for the trial of any person under their command who is subject to military law;
- (ii) A-2 warrants—Issued by the Central Government to the COAS empowering him to confirm the findings and sentence of a GCM held for trial of any person subject to military law. (See also para 7 below);
- (iii) A-3 warrants—Issued by the Central Government to officers Commanding Army, Army corps, division, independent brigade or equivalent commanders empowering them to confirm the findings and sentence of a GCM held for the trial of any person under their command who is subject to military law (See also para 7 below);
- (iv) B-1 warrants—Issued by the officers having power to convene a GCM to Brigade or equivalent commanders empowering them to convene a DCM for the trial of any person under their command who is subject to military law and to confirm the findings and sentence thereof.

- 7. Powers conferred by warrant. —Such warrants are normally addressed to an officer by the designation of his office and give authority to the officer on whom the command may devolve in his absence. Any such warrant may contain any restrictions, reservations or conditions (AA.ss.111 and 156) as the officer/ authority issuing it may think fit.
Under A-2 and A-3 warrants, if by the sentence of any GCM, a person subject to military law has been sentenced to suffer death, confirmation is to be withheld and the proceedings transmitted to the Central Government. Also in the case of any other GCM, in which the confirming authority thinks fit to do, the confirmation may be withheld and proceedings transmitted to the Central Government (if the confirming authority is the COAS) or to a superior authority (in other cases). B-l warrants contain no restrictions or special conditions.

8.Convening of SGCM. —A SGCM may be convened by an officer empowered in this behalf by an order of the Central Government or the COAS; and on active service by the Officer Commanding the forces in the field, or by any officer empowered by him in this behalf; and also by an Officer Commanding any detached portion of the regular Army, on active service, when in his opinion, it is not practicable with due regard to discipline and the exigencies of the service, that an offence should be tried by a GCM (AA.s.112).

9.Holding of SCM. —No convening order is necessary for the holding of a SCM. It may be held by the CO of any Corps, department or detachment of the regular Army (AA.ss.116(1) and 3(v)).

- (ii) Jurisdiction

- 10. Jurisdiction of GCsM and SGCsM. —A GCM and SGCM can try any person subject to the AA. They have complete jurisdiction to try any offence, though certain restrictions are placed by AA.s.70 upon their power to try cases of murder, culpable homicide and rape. They can award any punishment authorised by the AA including the punishment of death and imprisonment for life (AA.s.118).

- 11. Jurisdiction of DCM. —A DCM cannot try an officer or JCO. It can try a WO, but its powers of punishing him are limited. It has complete jurisdiction to try any offence, though the same restrictions are placed by AA.s.70 upon its powers to try cases of culpable homicide and rape as are imposed upon a GCM or SGCM.
A DCM cannot award a sentence higher than two years' rigorous or simple imprisonment (AA.s.119); it therefore cannot try a case of murder where the only punishment which can be awarded is death or imprisonment for life. A DCM cannot award a sentence of imprisonment to a WO (AA.s.119).

- 12. Jurisdiction of SCM. — A SCM cannot try an officer, a JCO or WO or a person subject to the AA as an officer, JCO or WO (AAs.120(3)). It has jurisdiction to try any offence under the AA except such as can only be committed by an officer, JCO or WO (e.g. an offence under AA.s.45). But in the case of certain offences the sanction of superior authority must be obtained unless immediate trial is considered by the CO to be necessary (AA.s120(2)). Certain restrictions are also placed by AA.s.70 upon its powers to try cases of culpable homicide and rape; it cannot, of course try a case of murder.
A SCM cannot award a sentence higher than one year's rigorous or simple imprisonment if the officer holding the trial is of the rank of Lt. Col and upwards, and three month's rigorous or simple imprisonment if such an officer is below that rank (AA.s.120(5)); it cannot, therefore, try a case of murder.

- 13. Prohibition of second trial. — A court-martial cannot try or punish a person for any offence of which he has been already acquitted or convicted by a court-martial or by a competent civil (Criminal) court or where the charge against him has been dismissed, or he has been dealt with summarily (AA.s.121, AR.53(1)(a))
The prohibition does not apply where there has been no valid trial, resulting in an acquittal or conviction, or where the finding and sentence which require confirmation, have not been confirmed. In such cases the offender can be tried afresh. Such fresh trial should be ordered only in exceptional circumstances (AA.ss.117(4) and 153).

Pardon or condonation by competent military authority, if proved, operates as a bar to the trial of an offender (AR 53(1) (b)).

- 14. Time limit for trial. — An offence other than mutiny, desertion or fraudulent enrolment cannot be tried by court-martial, if three years have elapsed since the date of its commission.
A person (other than an officer) cannot be tried even for desertion, other than desertion on active service, or for fraudulent enrolment if the said person, has, subsequently to the commission of offence, served continuously in an exemplary manner for not less than three years with any portion of the regular Army. (AA.s.122(4)). Also see Regs Army para 465.

- 15. Trials of persons to longer subject to the AA. — A court-martial can try a person who has ceased to be subject to the AA provided that the trial for the offence committed by him while so subject, commences within six months of his ceasing to be so subject. Such a person can be tried even though he has ceased to be subject to the AA for more than six months if the trial is for an offence of mutiny, desertion or fraudulent enrolment. (AA.s.123).

16.Place of trial. —An offence, wherever committed, may be tried and punished at any place whatever, (AA.s.124).

- (iii) Composition

17.Composition of GCM. —A GCM must be composed of at least five officers, each of whom have held commission for not less than three whole years and must be subject to the AA; and not less than four of the members of the court must be of a rank not below that of Captain. (AA.s.113).

The members of the court must, so far as practicable, belong to different corps or departments and in no case shall the court be composed exclusively of the officers of the corps or department to which the accused belongs. (AR.40(1)).

Members should be of equivalent or superior rank to the accused if he is an officer (AR 40(2)) and an officer under the rank of Captain must not be a member of a court trying a field officer (AR 40(3)). The members of the court may be mentioned by name in the convening order, or their rank and the unit to which they belong may alone be stated.

The senior member sits as the presiding officer. (AA.s.128).

Certain officers are disqualified from sitting as members. See para.21.

A JA must be appointed to sit on every GCM. (AA.s.129). Also see Regs Army para 459.

18.Composition of DCM.—The provisions as to the composition of a GCM referred to in para 17 above, also apply to DCM except that—

(a) the legal minimum of members required is three instead of five (AA.s.114);

(b) the length of commissioned service is two years instead of three (AA.s.114).

(c) AA.s.114 does not stipulate any particular rank of members;

(d) the members may be drawn exclusively from the corps or department to which the accused belongs; and

(e) a JA may or may not be appointed to sit on a DCM (AA.s,129).

- 19. Composition of SGCM. —A SGCM shall consist of not less than three officers. (AA.s.115).
Members should have held a commission for not less than one year; but, if any officers are available who have held commissions for not less than three years, they should be selected in preference to officers of less service. (AR.151(2)).

A JA may or may not be appointed to sit on a SGCM. (AA.s.129).

20.SCM.—A SCM may be held by the CO of any corps, department or detachment of the regular Army and he shall alone constitute the Court. The proceedings shall be attended throughout by two other persons, who shall be officers, junior commissioned officers or one of either and who shall not as such he sworn or affirmed. (AA.s.116).

21.Disqualification of officers.-Officers who are eligible through the length of their commissioned service to act as members of courts-martial may nevertheless be disqualified from serving on a particular court-martial. The following persons are disqualified in the case of a GCM and DCM: —

(i)the convening officer;

- (ii) the prosecutor;
- (iii) a witness for the prosecution;
- (iv) the CO of the accused or an officer who investigated the charges before trial or took down the summary of evidence;
- (v) the company etc., commander who made preliminary enquiry into the case;
- (vi) an officer who was a member of a court of inquiry into the matters on which the charges against the accused are founded;
- (vii) where the accused has been previously tried for the same offence, any officer who was a member of the court-martial by which the offence was tried; and
- (viii) an officer who has a personal interest in the case (AR 39(2)).
The provost-marshal or assistant provost-marshal is also disqualified from serving in a GCM or DCM. (AR.39(3)).

- (iv) Duties of convening officer

22.Consideration of proposed charges and evidence. —An application for a GCM or DCM should be accompanied by a summary of evidence (or abstract of evidence, in the case of officers) a charge-sheet and certain other documents stated on the form provided for such applications.

Before acceding to an application for a GCM or DCM submitted by a CO, the convening officer must consider the nature of the case, the statutory provisions and regulations applicable to it and, subject thereto, must use his discretion as to the mode of disposing of the application. He must satisfy himself that the charge submitted by the CO discloses an offence under the AA and is properly framed in accordance with the AR. He must also be satisfied that evidence sufficient to justify trial is disclosed in the summary or abstract of evidence; if he thinks that it does not, he should order the accused to be released; if he is in doubt, it is within his discretion to order the release of the accused or to refer the matter to superior authority. (AR.37(1)). In any case he may direct the CO to alter the form of the proposed charge in view of the evidence submitted; he may give directions that further evidence should be obtained; in a suitable case he may direct that the accused should be released without prejudice to his re-arrest till further evidence is forthcoming.

Where an accused person is to be arraigned on a serious charge, the other charges in respect of minor offences should be dropped.

If the convening officer considers that a case should be disposed of summarily or by SCM instead of by a DCM or GCM, he should take steps to effect this.

In all cases of trial by GCM and all cases of indecency, fraud or theft (except ordinary theft) and civil offences (except simple assaults) and in cases of doubt or difficulty, the charge and summary of evidence have to be submitted to DJAG of the command before trial is ordered. Regs Army para 458

23.Decision to try by court-martial. — If the convening officer is of opinion that the case should be tried either by a DCM or GCM, he will if the terms of the warrant granted to him permit, convene the court-martial. If the case is one for trial by a GCM and he holds no warrant to convene -such a court, he will refer the case to proper superior authority holding such a warrant.

24.Type of court-martial to be convened. — The powers of a SCM are sufficient to deal with all ordinary offences committed by persons below the rank of WO. In the case of aggravated offences, however, a DCM or GCM may properly be convened.

In deciding whether an accused should be tried by GCM or DCM, where the circumstances permit trial by either of these tribunals, the convening officer will bear in mind

(a) the nature of the offence;

(b) the prevalance of the particular offence charged;

(c) the general state of discipline in his command;

(d) the character of the accused: and

(e) the maximum sentence which can be imposed having regard to any sentence which the accused is already serving.

A case should not as a rule be sent for trial, unless there is reasonable probability that the accused person will be convicted. At the same time there may be cases where disgraceful charges have been preferred and where a court-martial affords the only means to the accused of clearing his character. See Regs Army para 405(c).

- 25. Order for trial by court-martial. — If the charges submitted by the CO are approved, or if they have been amended and the accused has again been remanded for trial by court-martial on the amended charges, they will be made into a charge-sheet (AR 28) and the convening officer or a staff officer on his behalf, will issue an order thereon directing trial by court-martial.
A convening officer will consider whether the charges upon which the accused is to be brought to trial are all to be contained in one charge-sheet or whether they should be inserted in different charge-sheets (AR 79(1)). Where an accused is ordered to be tried on a number of charges in the same charge-sheet he may apply to the convening officer or at the trial for any of the charges to be tried separately (AR.79(5)).

If the convening officer has ordered trial on separate charge-sheets he will direct the order in which the accused is to be tried (AR79(2)), and may direct the court that in the event of a conviction upon a charge in any charge-sheet, the accused need not be tried upon the subsequent charge-sheets (AR.79(4)).

Two or more accused may be tried jointly on one charge, and the charge-sheet may contain additional charges against one or more of the accused alleging offences committed separately provided they are part of the same series of offences (AR.35(1),(2)and(3)).

Where two or more accused are jointly charged, any one of them may apply to the convening officer or the court to be tried separately (AR.35(4)).

Each charge-sheet must be signed by the commanding officer of the accused and bear upon the face of it the convening officer's directions for trial (AR.31and notes thereto).

26.Convening orders. —Once it is decided that an accused will be tried by court-martial, an order for the assembly of the court, known as the convening order, will be issued. This order will be signed by the convening officer or by a staff officer on his behalf.

27.Papers for members etc.—The convening officer is responsible for ensuring that the members and JA (if appointed) receive the papers referred to in AR.37(4). These should be sent as soon as possible after the court has been convened.

- (v) Preparation of Defence

- 28. Information to be given to the accused—As soon as practicable after an accused has been remanded for trial by a GCM or DCM and at least 96 hours (or on active service 24 hours) before he is brought up for trial, an officer must give him a copy of the summary of evidence or in case of an officer where there is no summary of evidence an abstract of evidence, and apprise him of his rights in connection with the preparation of his defence (AR.33(7)).
As soon as trial has been ordered, a proper opportunity to prepare his defence must be afforded to the accused, who must be permitted to have free communication with any witnesses whom he may desire to call, and with any 'friend', defending officer or legal adviser whom he may wish to consult if they are available.

As soon as practicable before he is arraigned for trial, and at least 96 hours (or where the accused person is on active service 24 hours) before he is so arraigned, an officer must give him a copy of the charge-sheet and if necessary explain the charges to him. The said officer must also inform him of his rights in connection with the securing of witnesses on his behalf (AR.34(1)).

The officer shall also deliver to the accused a list of the names, rank and corps (if any) of the officers who are to form the court, and where officers in, waiting are named also of these officers (AR 34(3)).

The accused person shall have the right to address an application to the DJAG/AJAG of. the Command within which he for the time being is, if he is kept under arrest for a period longer than 48 days without being brought to trial or is not given full liberty for preparing his defence (AR.33(6)). -

- 29. Representation of the accused. The accused may defend himself or he may be represented by a defending officer or a counsel. If he intends to be represented by counsel, he must give notice to that effect, so that the convening officer, may, if he considers it desirable, obtain, the services of counsel on behalf of the prosecutor. If the accused does not intend to be, so represented but counsel has been obtained on behalf of the prosecutor, the convening officer must take steps to inform the accused to that effect not less than seven days before the trial, so that the accused may obtain counsel for his defence, if he so desires. Similar notice should be given to the accused where the convening officer intends to appoint or apply for the services of an officer with legal qualifications to act as prosecutor at the trial (AR.97).

- 30. Qualifications, duties of counsel and defending officer. —The qualifications of Counsel as also their functions, rights and duties are set out in ARs 96 to 101.
A defending officer has the same functions, rights and duties as a counsel (AR.95(3)). The friend of the accused can only act in an advisory capacity (AR 95(4)).

- 31. Assignment of defending officer for accused. —In order to ensure that an accused person is represented at his trial if he so desires, it is the duty of the officer referred to in para 28 above, at the time, he hands, the summary of evidence to the accused, to ask him to state in writing if he wishes to have a defending officer assigned to him by the convening officer (AR 33(7)); if he does so the convening officer must use his best endeavours to secure the services of a suitable officer (AR 95(2)).
- (vi) Assembly of Court

32.Assembly of Court. —A GCM or DCM will assemble at the time and place named in the convening order. If a JA has been appointed, he must be present, so should also be any waiting members detailed in the convening order to serve as members of the court, if required.

On assembly the members of the court will take their seats in accordance with their seniority (AR.75); the JA, if any, being seated on the right of the presiding officer.

The order convening the court, the charge-sheet and the summary (or abstract) of evidence will then be placed before the court, by the JA (or if no JA has been appointed, by the senior member), to whom they would have been forwarded previously by the convening officer (AR.37(4)).

At this stage no one should be in the court room except the members, the JA, if appointed, and the waiting members.

- 33. Inquiry as to composition of Court. —The court will examine the convening order for the purpose of ascertaining whether the members who have taken their seats, the JA, if any, and the waiting members present who may have been detailed are those mentioned in the order. If the members present are not actually named in the order they must be of the actual ranks and belong to the actual units stated therein. The presiding officer is not appointed by name and the senior member presides (AA.s.128). The court will also have regard to AR.40.
If the convening order appears on the face of it to be proper and to have been duly signed, the court will have fulfilled its first duty, namely that of satisfying itself, that the court is convened in accordance with the AA and AR (AR.41(1) (a)).

34.Inquiry as to legal minimum of members. —The court will next ascertain that the legal minimum of members required for a GCM or DCM, as the case may be, have been detailed and are present (AA.ss.113 and 114). Where the membership of the court, as detailed in the convening order, is incomplete, waiting members, if there are any, and if they are eligible and qualified, must take the place of absentee members.

If the number of members detailed in the convening order exceeds the legal minimum, but some of them are absent at the assembly of the court, the court should ordinarily adjourn unless sufficient waiting members are available in the place of the absentee members to make up the full number detailed in the convening order; but the court, in the interests of justice and for the good of the service, may proceed with the trial provided that the legal minimum is present. If the legal minimum is not present, the court must adjourn (AR.38).

- 35. Inquiry as to eligibility and qualification of members. —The court will then satisfy itself (AR 41(l)(c)) that all the members are eligible and not disqualified under the AA and AR. The eligibility of an officer depends on his status as an officer, i.e., on his being subject to military law or otherwise qualified to serve under the provisions of the AR and having held a commission for the required period. Disqualification is a personal question and depends on his being or having been in any manner a party to the case. The grounds of ineligibility and disqualification are set out in paragraphs 17, 18 and 21 above.
If the trial is by GCM, the court must be satisfied that the members are of the required rank (AA.s.113 and AR.40).

36.Judge Advocate. —Where a JA has been appointed, the court should ascertain that he has been duly appointed and is not disqualified (ARs.41(2) and 102). The convening officer appoints the JA, who must be an officer of the department of the Judge Advocate General, if such officer is available, or if no such officer is available, then an officer approved of by the Judge Advocate General or any of his deputies (AA.s.129). A JA must be appointed for every GCM, and may be appointed for a DCM (AA.s.129).

37.Powers of adjournment of court.-The court has wide discretionary powers of adjournment if not satisfied on any of the above matters.

Circumstances may arise which render adjournment compulsory e.g., if the court is finally reduced below the legal minimum. Any adjournment other than adjournments from day to day, with the reason therefore, should be reported to the convening officer (AR.41(3)).

- 38. Amenability of the accused and validity of the charge. —After ascertaining the validity of its constitution, the Court will next consider whether the accused is amenable to its jurisdiction (AR 42(l)(a)).
Finally, the court must be satisfied that each charge discloses an offence under the A A and is properly framed in accordance with AR; and is so explicit as to enable the accused readily to understand what he is to answer (AR 42 (l)(b)).

If not satisfied on the above matter, the court will report its opinion to the convening authority and may adjourn for the purpose (AR.42(2)).

- (vii) Opening of the court

39.Appearance of accused etc. —At the conclusion of the above preliminary proceedings the accused will be brought. before the court with his escort.

The prosecutor who must be a person subject to military law (with his counsel, if any) will take his place in court, and accommodation will be afforded for the. defending officer, defence counsel or 'friend' of the accused.

It is customary, though not obligatory, for the witnesses to be present in court from the time when the accused is brought in until after the members have been sworn; they must then withdraw and should not, as a rule, be allowed to be in the court when not under examination.

- 40. Opening of court. —The court is now open, and the public whether military or otherwise (including the press) may be admitted so far as accommodation permits. It may be closed at any time to enable the members to deliberate in closed court (AR.80).
The Court-Martial is an open court like other Courts of justice, but it has inherent powers to sit in camera if such course is necessary for the administration of justice.

- 41. Objection by the accused to members of the court. —The convening order will next be read in full by the presiding officer or JA (if any) and the members will answer to their names (AA.s.130 and AR.44). The accused will be asked whether he objects to be tried by any officer sitting on the court.
The AA and AR contain elaborate provisions as to the mode of enquiring and disposing of objections by or on behalf of the accused. If, upon a successful objection to a member, no waiting member, who is eligible and qualified, is available to fill the vacancy, the court should normally adjourn; but may proceed with the trial in certain circumstances, provided that there is a legal minimum of members present (AA.s.130, ARs 38 & 44).

Where, upon a successful objection to a member of the court, an adjournment is necessary, the convening officer can, if he pleases, convene a new court (AR 38(2)).

An accused has no right of objection to the prosecutor, J A or an officer under instruction.

42.Trial. of more than one accused. —Where more than one accused is ordered in one convening order to be tried by the same court, but on separate charge-sheets, they may all be brought before the court for the reading of the convening order. Each accused person shall have power to object to the members of the court and shall be asked separately whether he objects to any member (AR 89).

43.Swearing of court, judge advocate etc. —As soon as the court is finally constituted, the presiding officer will direct all persons to stand. The presiding officer, members, JA (if any) and officers under instruction will be sworn or affirmed, the shorthand writer and interpreter (if any) will also be sworn or affirmed at this stage, though a shorthand writer and interpreter may be sworn at any time during the trial. The accused has a right of objection to a shorthand writer or interpretor (AR 90(3)).

The form of oath or affirmation and the manner of taking it by all persons required to be sworn or affirmed and the persons who are to administer it are given in AR. Provision is also made whereby an oath or affirmation may be taken in such form as the court ascertains to be binding on the person's conscience (ARs.45, 47, 109 and 140).

44.Absence of members during trial. —A member of the court who has been absent during any part of the evidence ceases to be a member, and an officer cannot be added to a court-martial after the accused has been arraigned (AR 86(2)).

- (viii) Arraignment of Accused

- 45. Reading of charges. —As soon as the members, JA (if any) and others have been sworn, the accused will be arraigned on the charges contained in the charge-sheet.
The arraignment consists of the reading of each charge separately to the accused and asking him whether he is guilty or not guilty of it (AR 48). The JA or where there is no JA, the presiding officer conducts the arraignment.

If there are several charges in one charge-sheet, the accused may claim separate trial on each or any one charge on the ground that unless so tried he will be embarrassed in his defence (AR 79(5)).

If there are alternative charges in one charge-sheet and the accused pleads guilty to the first of such alternatives,the prosecutor may withdraw the other alternative charge or charges before the accused is arraigned upon them; otherwise the accused will be arraigned upon all the charges whether they are alternative or not (AR 52(3)).

If there is more than one charge-sheet the court must not arraign the accused upon any subsequent charge-sheet until the finding upon the first charge-sheet has been arrived at (AR 79(1)).

The accused, if charged jointly with any person whom he claims as a material witness for the defence, may apply if he has not already done so to be tried separately from that person, and the court may grant separate trial if the nature of the charge permits (AR 35(4)).

46.Plea to the jurisdiction. —An accused, before pleading to any charge may offer a plea to the general jurisdiction of the court and give evidence in support of that plea. The court will decide this question of jurisdiction in the same manner as any other question. If the plea is over-ruled, the court will proceed with the trial; if it is allowed the court must record its decision and the reason therefor, report to the convening officer and adjourn. Such decision is not subject to confirmation and the convening authority should either forthwith convene another court for the trial of the accused, or order his release. If in doubt as to validity of the plea, the court may either refer the matter to the convening authority or record a special decision and proceed with the trial (AR.51). A plea to the jurisdiction is a plea to the right to try the accused on any charge as distinct from a plea which relates to a particular charge.

- 47. Objection to charge. -Before pleading to any charge the accused may object to it on the grounds that it does not disclose an offence under the AA or as not being in accordance with the AR. If the court, disallows the objection the trial will proceed; if it allows it, it will or if in doubt, it may, adjourn to consult the convening authority who may amend the charge and direct that the trial be proceeded with (AR.49).
The court may always itself amend a mistake in the charge-sheet so far as it relates to the name and description of the accused but not otherwise (AR.50(1)).

Apart from any objection by the accused, the court has power, before any witnesses are examined, to report its opinion as to any charge which may appear to it to be faulty, to the convening authority, who may either amend the charge or direct a new trial to be commenced (AR 50(2)).

48.Recording of plea; refusal to plead, insanity etc. —The plea and objection referred to in the two preceding paragraphs having been disposed of (if raised), the accused's plea to the charges upon which he has been arraigned will be recorded; this will normally be 'guilty' or 'not guilty'. But the accused may refuse to plead or plead unintelligibly, in which case a plea of 'not guilty' must be recorded (AR.52(1)); or it may be urged that the accused is unfit to plead by reason of insanity for which event AA and AR make provision (AA.ss.145 to 149 and AR.145).

49.Plea in bar of trial. —In addition to pleading 'guilty' or 'not guilty' the accused may offer a plea in bar of trial on the ground that—

(a) he has been previously convicted or acquitted of the offence by a competent Criminal Court or Court-Martial; or

(b) he has been dealt with summarily under AA.ss.80, 83, 84 and 85 as the case may be, for the offence; or

(c) a charge in respect of the offence has been dismissed as provided in AR.22(2); or

(d) the offence has been pardoned or condoned by competent military authority; or

(e) the time which has elapsed between the commission of the offence and the commencement of trial is more than 3 years, and the time limit for trial is not extended under AA.s.122.

Upon the hearing of this plea evidence may be offered both by the accused and prosecutor and addresses may be made. If the court finds the plea not proved, it will proceed with the trial; if it finds it proved, it will record its finding and notify the same to the confirming authority and adjourn, though it may proceed with any other charge not affected by the plea. In either case its finding on the plea requires confirmation (AR.53).

- 50. Plea of guilty. —If the accused pleads 'guilty' to a charge, the presiding officer or JA (if any) must, before recording the plea, carefully explain to him the nature of the charge and the effect of his plea. It should also be pointed out to him that on a plea of 'guilty' there will be no regular trial but merely a consideration by the court of the sentence to be awarded, that he is entitled to make a Statement in mitigation of punishment and. call witnesses as to his character (AR.52(2)). He should also be informed that if he wishes to prove provocation or extenuating circumstances having direct relation to the Offence he should plead 'not guilty'.
Where an accused pleads guilty not to the offence charged but to an offence which the court after trial could have found him guilty or guilty subject to variations and exceptions under AR.62(4) and (5), the court may {instead of altering the plea to one of not guilty) accept such plea of guilty if it is satisfied of the justice of such course and the concurrence of the convening officer is signified by the prosecutor; provided, however, failure to obtain the concurrence of the convening authority will not invalidate the proceedings, when confirmed (AR 62 (9)),

The court cannot accept a plea of 'guilty' in a case where the accused is liable, if convicted, to be sentenced to death; in such a case a plea of 'not guilty' will be recorded (AR 52(4)).

51.Mixed plea.—-If the accused adheres to his plea of 'guilty', the court will then proceed to try the accused upon any other charge upon the same charge-sheet to which he has pleaded 'not guilty' and reach its finding thereon before proceeding further with the plea of 'guilty' (AR 54(1)). The AR make special. provisions in the case where the accused pleads guilty to the first of two or more alternative charges (ARs 52(3) and 54(2)).

52.Procedure on plea of guilty-. When the court proceeds with a plea of 'guilty' the summary (or abstract) of evidence will be read and sufficient evidence will be recorded to cover any deficiencies in the summary (or abstract). The accused may make a statement in reference to the charge and in mitigation of punishment, and witnesses as to character may be called (AR 54(4) and (7)).

If from the statement of the accused or from the summary (or abstract) of evidence or otherwise, it appears to the court that the accused did not understand the effect of his plea, the court must enter a plea of 'not guilty' and proceed with the trial (AR 54(5)).

The procedure in connection with taking evidence of character of the accused and the particulars of his service and the consideration and award of sentence is dealt with in paras.80 to 87 below.

53.Duties of Presiding Officer.-The presiding officer is responsible for the proper conduct of every trial whether the accused pleads 'guilty' or 'not guilty'. He must ensure that the accused does not suffer any disadvantage by reason of the fact that he is being tried or because of his ignorance or incapacity to make clear either his defence to the charge or the grounds upon which he relies in mitigation of any punishment which may be awarded (AR 76).

- (ix) Trial on plea of not guilty

54.Adjournment of trial on pica of not guilty.- Before proceeding with a trial on a plea of

not guilty, an accused will he asked whether he wishes to apply for an adjournment on the grounds that he has been prejudiced by non-compliance with any of the rules relating to procedure before trial or that he has not had sufficient opportunity to prepare his defence. If the court considers that he has been prejudiced either by non-compliance with any of the rules or because he had not had time to prepare his defence, it will grant an adjournment, if the interests of justice so require (AR 56(1) and (2)).

55.The prosecutor should always make an opening address if the case is a complicated one, and the court may require such address to be made. He should explain the substance of the charge and outline the proposed evidence to be called in support of it (AR 56(3)).

The prosecutor is not a partisan but an officer of justice whose duty it is, by laying all relevant facts in evidence before the court, to assist the court in ascertaining the truth. He must act with scrupulous candour, fairness and moderation towards the accused, the witnesses and the court (AR.77(1),(2)). Any departure from this rule of conduct should at once be checked by the court.

- 56. Witnesses for prosecution.-The witnesses for the prosecution will now be called. Each witness will take the necessary oath or make the required affirmation (AA.s.131 and AR.140). This provision will not, however, apply where the witness is a child under twelve years of age and the court-martial is of opinion that though the witness understands the duty of speaking the truth, he does not understand the nature of an oath or affirmation (AA.s.131(3)).
The examination of the witness will be conducted by the prosecutor who must be careful to refrain from asking leading questions. After giving evidence "in-chief" the witness may be cross-examined by the defence and after such cross-examination he may be re-examined by the prosecutor on matters arising out of cross-examination (IEA.s.137).

At the conclusion of the examination, cross-examination and re-examination, the presiding officer, JA (if any) and with the permission of the court any member of the court may question a witness at any time before he withdraws, but such questions should not be put until after the re-examination by the prosecutor; and the prosecutor and the defence may ask any questions through the court arising out of such examination (AR.142).

The members of the court should be careful when questioning a witness to ensure that they do not ask any questions which might result in inadmissible evidence being given.

If any objection is taken to a question by the witness, the court or the opposite party, the objection will be dealt with at the same time (AR.88). The court may order the witness to leave the court when the matter is discussed.

- 57. Recording of evidence. —As a witness gives his evidence, it must be translated (if not in English) and taken down in narrative form in the first person in as nearly as possible the words used; occasionally, it may be material or desirable to take down questions and answers verbatim. If there is no shorthand writer the JA or if there is none, the presiding officer must record the evidence or cause it to he recorded, and is responsible for its accuracy and the proceedings as a whole (ARs 91 and 92).

- 58. Interpreter,. —Where an interpreter is employed, great caution should be exercised to ensure accurate translation, and to guard against misconception of the true meaning of any expression, from either the incompetence or possible bias of the interpreter.
A member of a court-martial is not disqualified from acting as interpreter, but this is inconvenient where the evidence requiring interpretation is likely to be prolonged.

- 59. Reading over the evidence. —Before a witness withdraws, the whole of his evidence as recorded shall be read to him if he so requests; he may then make further explanations or corrections (AR 141(2)). Where evidence is recorded by shorthand writer, it shall not. be necessary to read the evidence of the witness to him if in the opinion of the court and the JA (if any) it is unnecessary so to do (AR 141(5)).

- 60. Plea of no case. —At the close of the case for the prosecution the defence may submit that the evidence adduced does not disclose a prima-facie case, against the accused and he should not, therefore, be called upon for his defence. The prosecutor may answer the submission and the defence may reply. If a JA is present, he may, if he thinks it necessary sum-up on the submission. The court will then close to consider the submission, the JA, if any, being present AR 57.
If the court allows the submission it will record a finding of 'not guilty' in respect of any one or more charges, to which the plea related. If the court over-rules the submission it will proceed with the trial. The submission will not be allowed if the court could on the evidence adduced, bring in a special finding.

- 61. Opening of defence. —At the close of the case of the prosecution, and after the plea of no case, if any, has been disallowed, the accused will be asked if he intends to call any witnesses either as to the facts or as to character; and his answer will be recorded.
If the accused states that he does not intend to call any witnesses as to the facts of the case, the accused may make a statement giving his account of the case; such statement may be made orally or in writing but no oath shall be administered to the accused. The court or the JA, if any, may question the accused for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstances appearing in his statement or in the evidence against him. The accused shall not render himself liable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions or by giving answers to them which he knows not to be true; but the court may draw such inference from such refusal or answers as it thinks just (AR 58(2)(a)).The accused may, if he wishes, call witnesses as to his character AR 58(2)(b)

- 62. Procedure on case for the defence. - If the accused states in answer to the question referred to in the preceding para, that he intends to call witnesses as or in writing but no oath shall be administered to the accused. The court or JA outlining the facts which it intends to prove (AR 59(a)).

- 63. Evidence for the defence. —The accused may then make a statement giving the subject of the charge against him; the statement may be made orally or in writing but no oath shall be administered to the accused. The court or JA (if any) may then question him as outlined in para 61 above (AR 59(b)).
The accused shall then call his witnesses including if he so desires any witnesses as to character (AR 59(c)).

64.Recalling of witnesses.—At the request of the prosecutor or accused and by leave of the court, a witness may be recalled at any time, for the purpose of having further questions put to him through the presiding officer or JA (if any) (AR 143(1)). The court may also allow the prosecutor to call or recall a witness to rebut any material statement made by a witness for the defence or for the purpose of giving evidence on any new matter which the prosecutor could not have reasonably foreseen (AR 143 (2)) or as a reply to the witnesses to character called for the defence, to prove previous convictions against the accused (AR 143(3)). In all these cases the additional evidence must be given before the closing address by or on behalf of the accused.

The court may of their own motion, call or recall any material witness if it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice; such witness may be called or recalled at any time before the finding of the court is arrived at (AR 143(4)).

- 65. Withdrawal of plea of not guilty. —An accused person is at liberty. at any time, to withdraw a plea of 'not guilty' and plead 'guilty' (AR 55).

- 66. Closing addresses. -—The order in which the prosecutor and defence addresses the court depends on whether the accused calls witnesses to the facts. The procedure is laid down in ARs 58 and 59. Where the accused does not call witnesses to facts, the defence has the right of reply.

- 67. Latitude to accused in defence. —The accused must be allowed great latitude in making his defence, and will not, within reasonable limits be stopped by the court merely for making irrelevant observations.
In no case may the prosecutor or defence in the course of an address state as a fact any matter which has not been proved.

- 68. Summing up by judge advocate. —When the closing addresses have been given, the JA (if any) will sum up the evidence and advise the court upon the law relating to the case (ARs 60 and 105(5)). After the summing up of the JA, no other address will be allowed. All addresses by the prosecutor and the defence and the summing up of the JA may either be given orally or in writing, and if in writing, shall be read in open court (AR 144). As a rule the summing up of the JA should be in writing.

- 69. Time and place of trial. —ARs80, 81 and 82 lay down for the sitting of the court, hours of sitting and adjournment respectively.

- 70. Views. —Where a court considers it necessary to view any place it may do so at any time before finding (AR 82(2)), but there must be present at such view not only the presiding officer and member of the court and the JA, if any, but also the prosecutor, the accused and his defending officer or counsel.
- (x) Deliberation of finding

- 71. Finding in closed' court. - The finding must be deliberated in closed court, the members, JA (if any), and officers under instruction alone being present {AR 61(1)). The court must record a finding on every charge upon which the accused is arraigned, including any alternative charge (AR 62(1)).

- 72. Onus of proof reasonable doubt, corroboration. —At the outset of its deliberations the court must remember that the accused is presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty, and that the burden of proof rests upon the prosecution. Unless, therefore, the guilt of the accused is established beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted, as the prosecution has failed to sustain adequately the burden of proving his guilt.
It is legally open to a court to convict an accused person upon the evidence of one credible witness. But in some cases corroboration of such witness is required, by practice almost amounting to a rule of law; in others it is desirable that corroboration should be looked for, though not actually required by law or practice.

- 73. Extraneous consideration. —The court, in considering its decision must not be influenced by the consideration of any supposed intention of the convening authority in sending the accused for trial by a particular kind of court-martial. In many cases the convening authority will have decided no more than a prima-facie case against the accused is shown upon the summary of evidence and he will have formed no opinion as to the guilt of the accused. An acquittal, therefore, is not in itself a reflection upon the convening authority. Even if it were, it would afford no reason whatever for a court to convict, unless the evidence establishes the charge.

- 74. Proof of facts charged; special finding on the charge. —The court must decide whether the facts alleged in the particulars of each charge have been proved in evidence, and if proved, whether they disclose the offence stated in the charge itself or an offence which it may, pursuant to its powers under AA.s.139, find the accused guilty. Thus on a charge of desertion, it may find the particulars as to the period of absence proved, but not the intent to leave the service altogether or to avoid some particular important duty-a necessary ingredient of the charge, in such a case, it may return a. finding of not guilty of desertion, but guilty of absence without leave (AA.s.139(1)).

- 75. Special findings as to the particulars of a charge. -—Where the court finds what the facts proved in evidence differ materially from the facts alleged in the particulars of a charge, but are nevertheless. sufficient to prove the offence charged, and the difference is not so material as to have prejudiced the accused in his defence, it may record a special finding as to the particulars. Thus, on a charge of desertion, if the court is satisfied that the charge as laid is proved, but the period of absence is shorter than that alleged in the particulars, it may make special finding to that effect (AR 62(4) and (5)).

- 76. Reference to Confirming Authority before finding. —If the court doubts whether the facts proved show the accused to be guilty of the offence charged or of any other offence of which he may be found guilty under the AA, before recording its finding it may refer the matter to the confirming authority, setting out the facts which it finds proved. The court may follow similar procedure in respect of alternative charges (AR 62(3} and (8)).

- 77. Voting on the finding. Every member must give, by word of mouth, his opinion as to the finding which should be made on each charge separately (AR 87(1)). The opinions must be taken in succession beginning with the member lowest in rank (AR 87(2)). If the votes given are equal the accused will be deemed to be acquitted. The presiding officer has no second or casting vote upon the finding. The majority of votes will decide the issue, and the finding of the majority will be recorded as the finding of the court (AAs.132(1)).
The finding on each charge shall be announced forthwith, in open court as subject to confirmation (AR 62(10)).

- 78. Acquittal.—A finding of acquittal by a court-martial (other than SCM), whether upon all or any one or more of the charges in the charge-sheet is not valid until continued by the confirming authority (AA.s.153), and it may be revised (AA.s.160).
The record of the proceedings in the case of an acquittal upon the charges in a charge-sheet will be authenticated by the signatures of the presiding officer and A (if any) and forwarded to the confirming officer (AR 63).

- 79. Guilty but of unsound mind.--Where the court finds that the accused is guilty of the offence charged but was by reason of unsoundness of mind incapable of knowing the nature of the act or knowing that it was wrong or contrary to law, the court shall record a finding accordingly (AAs.145(1)), and the presiding office shall forthwith report the case to the confirming officer (AAs. 145(2)). If the confirming officer does not confirm the finding, he shall take steps to have the accused tried by the same or another court-martial for the same offence (AA.s.145(3)).
- (xi) Proceedings on conviction

- 80. Evidence as to character and service—If the finding upon any charge is guilty (whether or not the accused has pleaded guilty thereto) and the trial in respect of all charges and charge-sheets has been completed, the court for the purpose of determining its sentence, shall, whenever possible, take evidence of and record the general character, age, service, rank and any recognised acts of gallantry or distinguished conduct etc., of the accused.
This evidence must be given by a witness on oath or affirmation, usually the prosecutor, who will produce extracts from the regimental books relating to the accused in accordance with the Rules. The accused or his representative may then cross-examine this witness. Oral evidence of bad character cannot be given for the prosecution.

The accused may call evidence as to his good character at this stage, as well as during the hearing of the case for the defence, and the prosecutor has the right of cross-examination to test the veracity of such evidence, even if he thereby brings out evidence of the accused's bad character.

After all the evidence as to character has been given, the accused or his representative may address the court thereon and in mitigation of punishment (AA.s.144 and AR 64(4)).

The court will then be closed for consideration of sentence.

- 81. Postponement of sentence.—Where several accused are tried separately by the same court on charges arising out of the same transaction, the court may, if it considers it desirable in the interests of justice, postpone consideration of any sentence to be awarded to any one or more persons until the trials of all such accused persons have been completed (AR 89(4)).
- (xii) Award of sentence

82.Legality and form of sentence.—The punishment awarded must be one of those allowed by the AA (AA chapter VII), in some cases a combination of punishments is permitted by AA (AA.s.73).

One sentence only must be awarded in respect of all the offences of which an accused person has been found guilty, even if the trial has proceeded on different charge-sheets, and where an accused person has been found guilty on several charges, a sentence which can legally be awarded in respect of one of them will be valid not-withstanding that it could not legally have been awarded in respect of the others (AR 65).

The sentence should follow the prescribed forms set out in Appendix III to ARs; or, if no form is exactly applicable, it should follow as nearly as possible the words of the AA.

- 83. Discretion as to sentence.—A court-martial has (except in the case of an obligatory punishment for an offence under AA.s.69 e.g., murder) an absolute discretion as to its sentence. It may award the maximum punishment prescribed for the particular offence charged or such less punishment as is laid down in AA.s.71, which sets out a graduated scale of punishments which a court-martial may- award (AA.s.72).

- 84. Considerations affecting sentence.—A court-martial awarding punishment should take into consideration the following points:-
(a) The maintenance of discipline: The proper amount of punishment to be inflicted is the least amount by which discipline can effectively be maintained; occasionally the exigencies of discipline, apart from the circumstances of the case may render a severe sentence necessary, but in all cases the whole force should be in a position to realize that the punishment awarded to an individual is not more than is necessary in the interests of the force itself and for the maintenance of that discipline, without which any body of troops must become an irresponsible mob and useless for the purpose for which it exists. It must be the object of all concerned to aim at that high state of discipline which springs from a military system administered with judgment and impartiality and to induce in all ranks a feeling of confidence that, while no offence will be passed over, no offender will in any circumstances suffer injustice.

(b) Degrees of criminality: A NCO should be dealt with more severally than a sepoy; where several offenders are found guilty of the same offence it may be proper to award different amounts of punishment.

(c) Premeditation:An accused who has clearly made long preparation to commit some crime should be more severely punished than one who has acted on the spur of the moment.

(d) Provocation:While provocation is no defence to a charge the court will no doubt take this matter into consideration.

(e) Previous convictions: An habitual offender deserves more punishment than an infrequent offender, and a first offender if possible be treated leniently.

(f) Prevalence of offence : Military offences must sometimes be considered in reference to circumstances other than those connected with the individual offender. When there is a general prevalence of offences or of offence of a particular kind, an example may be necessary, and on that account a severe punishment may properly be awarded, in respect of an offence which would otherwise receive a more lenient punishment. In such cases the punishment must be regarded more from the point of view of the effect which it will produce on the force to which the offender belongs than that of the offender himself.

The court must always award such punishment as the members consider to be just and proper and must not presume that (he convening authority, in sending the case for trial, took a more serious view of the facts.

- 85. Recommendation to mercy.—The court may, in awarding sentence, make a recommendation to mercy, but in view of the discretion of the court in the matter of awarding sentence, such a recommendation would he unusual, except in cases where the court can award only one punishment. If such recommendation is made, it must form part of the proceedings and the reason for it must be recorded (AR 66).

- 86. Voting on the sentence.—Every member of the court must give his opinion as to the sentence to be awarded, even if he had voted for an acquittal upon the finding. The officer junior in rank must first give his opinion, In the case of an equality of votes, the decision must be in favour of the accused. The presiding officer has no second or casting vote upon the sentence. An absolute majority of the opinions of the members must be secured (AA.s.132); a sentence of death cannot be passed by a GCM without the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the members. A sentence of death cannot be passed by a SGCM without the concurrence of all the members (AA.s.132).

- 87. Announcement of the sentence.—The sentence together with recommendation to mercy, if any, and the reasons for such recommendation will be announced in open court as subject to confirmation (AR 67).
Upon the court awarding the sentence, the record will be dated and signed by the presiding officer and JA (if any). The JA or if there is none, the presiding officer, will then forward the proceedings to the DJAG or AJAG of the command in cases of trial by GCM and direct to the confirming authority in cases of trial by DCM; who must in all cases where the sentence is dismissal or above seek advice of the DJAG or AJAG of the command before confirmation (AR 69).

- (xiii) Confirmation and revision

- 88. Conviction not valid until confirmation.—A finding of a GCM or DCM and the sentence consequent thereon arc not valid until confirmed (AA.s.153)).
Until promulgation has been effected, confirmation is not complete and the finding and sentence shall not be held to have been confirmed until they have been promulgated (AR.71).

- 89. Confirmation of GCM, DCM.—The finding and sentence of a GCM are to be confirmed by the Central Government or by any officer empowered in this behalf by warrant of the Central Government (AA.s.154).
The finding and sentence of a DCM are to be confirmed by any officer having power to convene a GCM or by any officer empowered in this behalf by warrant of such officer {AA.s.155).

Authority to confirm given by warrants may contain such restrictions, reservations or conditions as the issuing authority may think fit. The warrants at present issued under AA are explained in paras 6 and 7 above. A member of a court-martial or an officer who acted as a prosecutor at a court-martial cannot confirm the finding or sentence of that court-martial (AR 74). Similarly, an officer who as the CO investigated the charges or who for the time being is the accused's CO should not confirm the finding or sentence (see Regs Army para 471).

If proceedings are confirmed in error by an officer not having power to confirm, his act and the subsequent promulgation are null and it is open to the proper authority to confirm.

- 90. Confirmation of findings and sentences on board a ship.-When any person is tried and sentenced by a court-martial while on board a ship, the finding and sentence if not confirmed and executed on board the ship, may be confirmed and executed at the port of disembarkation (AA.s.159).

91.Revision of finding and sentence.—Upon receipt of proceedings the confirming authority, before confirming, may direct the re-assembly of the court for the purpose of revising their finding and sentence or either of them. Only one revision can be ordered or made. If the court is directed to take fresh evidence, such evidence must be taken in open court and in the presence of the accused (AA.s.160, AR.68).

If the finding is sent back for revision and the court does not adhere to it, it must revoke it and record a new finding. If the finding is revoked, it must also revoke the sentence, and, if the new finding involves a sentence, (ie., is not an acquittal) must pass a new sentence.

If the sentence only is sent back for revision, the court may not revise the finding. In practice revision of sentence only (unless it is intended to increase the punishment) is seldom necessary in view of the powers of the confirming officer.

Both the new finding and sentence awarded, if any, must be announced in open court as being subject to confirmation.

- 92. Non-confirmation and: retrial.—As the finding and sentence of a GCM and DCM are not valid until confirmed (AAs.153) a refusal of confirmation duly entered upon the proceedings, operates to annul the whole trial. In such a case the accused has not been acquitted or convicted and may legally be tried again; but re-trials should rarely be resorted to, unless the needs of discipline and justice demand that an offender shall not escape punishment on account of a legal technicality. It must be remembered that if an accused at the trial has disclosed his defence, that defence at the second trial may thereby be prejudiced. Re-trial should not be ordered until the DJAG or AJAG of the command had been consulted and the sanction of superior authority obtained. If the confirming authority considers that the proceedings of a court-martial are illegal or involve substantial injustice to an accused person, he will withhold its confirmation.
It is open to the confirming officer to withhold confirmation, either wholly or in part, and then refer the proceedings to a superior authority competent to confirm them (AR.70).

- 93. The confirming authority has no power to alter or amend the finding, whether original or revised of a court-martial. After one revision or if he does not order a revision, he can only confirm it or refuse confirmation, and any superior authority to whom he may refer the proceedings for confirmation is in the same position.
Similarly, the confirming authority cannot alter the finding on a plea in bar of trial or on a finding of insanity, both of which require confirmation to support their validity.

Where the confirming authority refuses confirmation of the finding of guilty on some but not on all charges, he must take into consideration the fact of such non-confirmation and mitigate etc., the sentence as may seem just, having regard to the offences in the charges, the findings on which he has confirmed (AR 72).

- 94. Power of confirming authority over sentences.—The following are the powers of the confirming authority with relation to the sentences of court-martial whether or not they have been revised: —
(a) Mitigation of punishment to a less amount of the same punishment (AA.s.158 and AR 72).

(b) Remission of the whole or part of a sentence (AA.s.158 and AR.72).

(c) Commutation of the punishment to a different form of punishment lower in the scale of punishments authorised in AA.s.71 (AA.s.158 and AR.72).

(d) Variation of a sentence informally expressed, or which is in excess as regards its duration of the punishment allowed by law (e.g., three years' imprisonment awarded by a DCM) (AR 73).

(e) Suspension of the execution of the sentence (which will, however, be in force during the suspension). This power can only be exercised by the Central Government, the COAS or any officer empowered to convene a GCM or SGCM, and only where the sentence awarded is one of imprisonment. If the confirming authority is not one of the authorities mentioned above, he can direct that the offender shall not be committed until the orders of such authority have been obtained (AA.ss.182 and 183).

(f) In the case of sentences of imprisonment not combined with dismissal the confirming authority may direct that the sentence shall be carried out by confinement in military custody or military prison (if it has been established). Unless a direction to this effect is given, the offender has to be committed to a civil prison (except on active service) which is most undesirable in the case of a person who is to return to duty after undergoing his punishment. Sentences of imprisonment, combined with dismissal should, as a rule, be undergone in civil prison.

- (xiv) Promulgation

- 95. Promulgation of finding etc.—The charge, finding and sentence and any recommendation to mercy must be promulgated to the accused as well as the confirmation and non-confirmation of the proceedings. Promulgation must be Carried out in such manner as the confirming authority may direct; and if no direction is given, according to the custom of the service. Also see Regs Army para 472.
As confirmation is not complete until promulgation the confirming authority may always alter its minute of confirmation or non-confirmation before the proceedings have been promulgated; (AR 71).

- (xv) Procedure after promulgation

- 96. Setting aside conviction.—Even after promulgation, the authority who confirmed the finding and sentence (or any authority superior to him) on the advice of the DJAG or AJAG, may direct the record of the conviction to be erased and the accused to be relieved of all consequences of his trial if he thinks that the proceedings are illegal or that circumstances have arisen which show that the accused could not have been guilty, or that the conviction involves substantial injustice to the accused (AA.s.165).
When the conviction on any one but not all the charges has been annulled, the authority having power to mitigate etc., the sentence under AA.s.179, must take into consideration the fact of such annulment, and mitigate etc., the sentence as may seem just having regard to the offences the convictions on which have not been annulled (AR 72).

97.Substitution of valid for invalid finding or sentence.—If after promulgation a finding is found to be invalid the authority which would have had power under AA.s.179 to commute the punishment awarded by the sentence if the finding had been valid, may substitute a new finding and pass a sentence specified or involved in such finding, provided, however, no such substitution shall be made unless such finding could have been validly made by the court-martial on the charge and unless it appears that the court-martial must have been satisfied of the facts establishing the said offence.

If after promulgation a sentence passed by a court-martial, not being a sentence passed in pursuance of a new substituted finding, is found for any reason to be invalid, the authority referred to in the sub-para above may pass a valid sentence. The punishment awarded by a sentence passed after substitution of a new finding or sentence shall not be higher in the scale of punishments than or in excess of the punishment awarded by, the sentence for which a new sentence is substituted (AA.s.163).

98.Mitigation etc., after confirmation.—After promulgation the punishment awarded can only be mitigated, remitted or commuted by the authorities referred to in AA.s.179, and suspended sentences can be remitted by the authorities referred to in AA.s.182.

- 99. Date from which sentence operates.—A sentence of imprisonment must be reckoned to commence on the day on which the original proceedings (irrespective of the revision, if any) were signed by the presiding officer of the court. If, therefore, a sentence is ultimately confirmed and promulgated, it will probably have been running for several days, although not yet put into actual execution (AA.s.167).

- 100. Custody of court-martial proceedings.—After promulgation, court-martial proceedings (other than SCM proceedings) must be forwarded to the DJAG of the command for transmission for the safe custody to the office of the JAG, where they must be preserved for not less than seven years in the case of GCM or three years in the case of SGCM and DCM (AR 146).
A copy of the proceedings shall be supplied (except where the Central Government certified that it is against the interests of the security of the state or friendly relations with foreign states) to any person tried by court-martial if he demands it (ARs.147 and 147A).

- 101. A person who considers himself aggrieved by the finding or sentence of a GCM, DCM or SGCM may forward a petition to the confirming authority before confirmation and after confirmation to the Central Government, COAS or any officer superior to the one who confirmed such finding or sentence (AA.s. 164 and AR 201). In the case of a SCM, the aggrieved person may present a petition to any officer, having power not less than a brigade commander, superior to the officer holding the trial, the reviewing authority through the usual channels (AR 201). Also see Regs Army para 364.
- (xvi) Summary COURT-MARTIAL

- 102. The jurisdiction of a SCM is dealt with in paras 12 to 14 above. A CO is not ordinarily competent to try by a SCM a charge for any offence specified in AA.s.120(2) without the sanction of the superior authority. He may, however, do so if he considers that there is grave reason for immediate action and reference cannot, without detriment to discipline, be made to the officer empowered to convene a DCM or on active service a SGCM. If he tries without reference such an offence, he must attach an explanatory memorandum to the proceedings (AR.130). In all cases of indecency, fraud or theft (except ordinary theft) and civil offences (except simple assault) and in any case of doubt or difficulty, the charge-sheet and summary of evidence are to be submitted to the DJAG or AJAG of the command before trial is ordered (Regs Army para 458).

- 103. When a CO applies to the officer referred to in para 102 above for sanction to hold a SCM the summary of evidence and charge-sheet will be submitted with the application. In forming his decision whether the case should be tried by SCM or by some other tribunal the officer receiving the application should remember that the powers of a SCM are sufficient to deal with all ordinary offences committed by persons below the rank of WO. In the case of aggravated offences which appear to merit a higher punishment than a SCM can award, a GCM or DCM may properly be convened, and it is generally undesirable that a CO should try by SCM a case in which he has a personal interest (AA.s.120). Sanction to try any offence by SCM may, however, legally be given by the proper authority.
The officer receiving the application has a duty similar to that of a convening authority of satisfying himself that the charge is properly framed and that the evidence is sufficient to justify trial, and he may direct the CO to alter the charge or to obtain further evidence; in a suitable case, he, may order the release of the accused or the case to be dealt with summarily. The authority sanctioning trial by SCM will insert or cause to be inserted on the charge-sheet his order for trial by that tribunal.

- 104. Preparation of defence by accused.—As soon as trial is ordered, proper opportunity to prepare his defence must be afforded to the accused, who must be allowed to have free communication with any witness whom he may desire to call and with any 'friend' or legal adviser whom he may wish to consult if they are available (AR 33(2)).
As soon as practicable before he is arraigned for trial (and not less than ninety-six hours or on active service twenty-four hours before such arraignment) an officer roust give him a copy (and a translation thereof in a language which he understands, if so desired by the accused) of the charge-sheet, and if necessary read and explain to him the charge-sheet and charges. The officer in question must also inform him of his rights in connection with the securing of witnesses on his behalf (AR 34).

- 105. Composition of SCM.—The CO of the accused, as defined in AA.s.3(v), alone constitutes the court, but the presence throughout the proceedings of two other persons who shall be officers or junior commissioned officers or one of either is essential to the legality of the trial (AA.s.116). These officers or junior commissioned officers are not sworn/affirmed, take no part in the proceedings and have no special duties, but the officer holding the trial may consult them, if he so desires. The accused cannot object to the court or interpreter.

- 106. Interpreter.—An interpreter will be appointed when any evidence is given in a language which the court or the accused or an officer or junior commissioned officer attending the trial does not understand (AR 107). If an interpreter has been appointed he must take the interpreter's oath or affirmation though the proceedings arc not necessarily invalidated by failure to swear or affirm the interpreter (AR 149). It will generally be convenient that the officer holding the trial should (if competent to interpret in the language of the accused) himself take the interpreter's oath or affirmation prescribed for the court. If necessary, he can appoint a competent interpreter, who may be one of the officers attending the trial.

- 107. 'Friend' of the accused and prosecutor.—An accused may be assisted by a 'friend'; but such 'friend' whether a legal adviser or not, may only assist the accused by suggesting questions and preparing the defence; he is not allowed to examine or cross-examine witnesses, personally address the court, or take any part in the proceedings (AR 129).
A prosecutor is not appointed; the prosecution is conducted by the court.

108.Assembly of court and arraignment of accused.-When the court assembles, the officer holding the trial i.e., the court and the interpreter, if any, will be sworn or affirmed in the manner prescribed in the AR (AR 109). The accused will then be arraigned (AR 111) and may object to the charge (AR 112).At any time during the trial the court may amend the charge-sheet in so far as it relates to the name and description of the accused, and at any time before it has begun to examine witnesses it may amend a defective charge and proceed with the trial, after giving the accused due notice of the amendment, and with the sanction of higher authority if the amended charge requires such sanction (AR 113).

109.Procedure on plea of guilty or not guilty and special pleas.—On a plea of 'guilty' or 'not guilty', if a special plea to the jurisdiction of the court or in bar of trial is offered, the procedure laid down for a GCM or DCM is applicable with necessary modifications (ARs114 to 118).

After all the evidence for the prosecution has been given the accused will be asked if he has anything to say in his defence, and may address the court in his defence or may defer such address until he has called his witnesses. The court may question the accused on the case for the purpose of enabling him to explain any circumstances appearing in his statement or in the evidence against him.

The accused may then call his witnesses, including witnesses to character (AR 118).

The court may, if it thinks it necessary in the interests of justice, call witnesses in reply to the defence (AR.119).

commissioned officers are not sworn/affirmed, take no part in the proceedings and have no special duties, but the officer holding the trial may consult them, if he so desires. The accused cannot object to the court or interpreter.

- 110. Consideration of finding and procedure on acquittal and conviction:-The court must make a finding on every charge upon which the accused has been arraigned, including any alternative charge (AR 121(1)).
In considering the finding, the court must have regard to the considerations set out in paras 73, 75 and 76 above.

If the finding upon all the charges in a charge-sheet is not guilty, the court will date and sign the proceedings, the findings will be announced in open court and the accused will be released (AR 122).

If the finding upon any charge is guilty, and the trial in respect of all charges and charge-sheets have been completed, the court records of its own knowledge or takes and records evidence of, the character, age, service etc., of the accused (AR 123) and sentence is awarded (AR.124).

- 111. Sentence.—In considering the sentence, the court must have regard to the considerations set out in para 84 above and should bear in mind the general instructions and normal scale of punishments contained in Regs Army para 448. ASGM cannot award a sentence higher than one year's rigorous imprisonment, if the officer holding the trial is of the rank of and upwards, and three months if such officer is below that rank (AA.s.120).
It is desirable that sentences of three months imprisonment or less awarded to a person whose services it is desired to retain should be undergone in military custody; the court should, therefore, have regard to AA.s.169(3) and while awarding such a sentence to which no sentence of dismissal is added, direct that the sentence shall be carried out by confinement in military custody. Unless a direction to this effect is given, the offender has to be committed to civil prison (except on active service). Sentences of imprisonment combined with dismissal should, as a rule, be undergone in civil prison.

Under AA.s.183(2), the officer holding the SCM may direct that an offender sentenced to imprisonment be not committed until the orders of superior military authority have been obtained.

- 112. Proceedings not open to revision and do not require confirmation.— The proceedings of a SCM cannot be revised and do not require confirmation. The sentence awarded by the court should, therefore, except as provided in AA.ss.161(2) and 183(2) be put into execution forthwith, the offender being also committed, if the sentence is one of imprisonment for three months or more to undergo the unexpired portion of any former suspended sentence (AA.s.188(b)).

113.The proceedings must be forwarded for review (through the DJAG of the command in which the trial is held) to the officer commanding the division or brigade within which the trial is held or to the prescribed officer (AA.s. 162 and AR 133).

The reviewing officer should, if he considers that justice has been done and that proceedings may legally be upheld, countersign the proceedings or a staff officer should record that he has seen them, and he may enter thereon any remarks he may consider to be called for or necessary for the future guidance of the officer who held the trial. If a direction under AA.s.183(2) (regarding suspension of sentence) has been recorded, he will, if he is himself a superior military authority, issue his orders thereon, or if not himself a superior military authority, forward the proceedings for the orders of such an authority. The reviewing officer can, for reasons based on the merits of the case, set aside the proceedings or the conviction on one or more of several charges or reduce a legal sentence to any other which the court might have passed. If the sentence is illegal it may be treated as a nullity, and if invalid one of the authorities referred to in AA.s.163 can substitute a valid sentence. If he decides to treat it as nullity, he should when countersigning the proceedings, set aside the sentence and direct that the accused be relieved of all consequences of the sentence, though not of the conviction.

After review the proceedings will be returned to the corps to which the accused belonged where they are preserved for not less than three years (AR 146(2)).

- (xvii) Summary General Court-Martial

- 114. Composition and powers. —The court consists of three members (AA.s.115) and has the same powers as a GCM (AA.s.118). The officers should have held commissions for not less than one year, but, if any officers are available who have held commissions for not less than three years, they should be selected in preference to officers of less service (AR 151(2)).

- 115. SGCM in time of peace. —A court of this character is not suited to peace conditions, but it may some times be necessary to convene such a court at a remote station where a sufficient number of officers to constitute a GCM are not available. The power to convene a SGCM in time of peace is restricted to officers empowered in this behalf by an order of the Central Government or the COAS (AA.s.112(a)) and the officer convening the court should direct that the evidence and the statement of the accused in defence should be recorded in full, instead of in the abbreviated form allowed by AR.160, the proceedings being thus assimilated, so far as circumstances permit, to those of an ordinary GCM.

- 116. SGCM on active service. On active service a SGCM may be convened by: —
(a) the officer commanding the forces in the field, or any officer empowered by him; or

(b) an officer commanding any detached portion of the regular Army.

The last mentioned officer, however, can convene the court only when, in his opinion, it is not practicable having due regard to the exigencies of the service to try the offence by an ordinary GCM. Such opinion should be recorded in the order convening the court (AA.s.112(b)and (c)).

- 117. Procedure. - A SGCM is subject to exceptional rules (ARs 151 to 165) under which the procedure is or can be of a more summary character than that of an ordinary GCM. But provision is made whereby a large number of the rules which are applicable to GCM or DCM should be applied to a SGCM, so far as practicable having regard to the public service (AR.164).
- (xviii) Suspension of sentences

- 118. Suspension of sentence. —Where a sentence of imprisonment for life or imprisonment has been awarded by a court-martial, the confirming authority when confirming, if the sentence requires confirmation or the officer holding the trial, if the sentence does not require confirmation, should consider whether the offender should be committed to undergo his sentence or whether he should be kept in arrest pending the orders of the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1) as to his commitment or release under suspended sentence. If the said authority or officer has issued general instructions under AA.s.182(2), that no person sentenced to imprisonment for life or imprisonment shall be committed to prison or to military custody until his orders have been obtained, the confirming authority or the officer holding the trial should defer committing the offender to undergo his sentence until the directions of the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1) have been taken. If the confirming authority or the officer holding the trial decides to recommend the sentence tor suspension or is bound to refer the case to the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1), he will record a direction on the proceedings of the court-martial that the offender be not committed to undergo his sentence until the orders of such authority or officer have been obtained (AA.s.182).
If the confirming authority is also competent to take action under AA.s.182(1), he may dispense with the direction referred to above and forthwith issue orders as to suspension of sentence.

The authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1) may suspend a sentence at any time, whether or not it has been put into execution and may order a suspended sentence into execution, provided that the sentence is still running and that the offender is still subject to the AA.

It should be noted that whether the sentence is put into execution or is suspended it will run as from the date of award until it normally expires: suspension does not affect the continuity of the sentence (AA.s.185).

119.The considerations which guide an officer in deciding whether or not it is advisable to suspend a sentence immediately after trial are many and vary with the state of discipline of the force under his command, the nature of the duties on which it is engaged, and the character of the person concerned.

Suspension of sentences is primarily applicable to offences of a military nature only, although in special cases it may be applied to offences of a civil character.

In all cases special attention should be directed to the following points: --

(a) the age and previous character of the offender;

(b) whether the offence is a first one;

(c) whether the offence was premeditated;

(d) whether the offender was at the time subjected to any special stress,fatigue, disability or temptation;

(e) whether the offender was influenced by others older or of worse character than himself.

On active service additional consideration may arise. For example some persons may deliberately commit crimes in the hope that a long sentence may enable them to avoid doing duty with their units, whilst others may commit grave military offences through momentary loss of control over their nerves and without any wrongful intent. Each case, therefore, must be considered on its merits, it being remembered, that the system of suspension of sentence is designed, on the one hand, to ensure instant punishment for those who properly deserve it, and on the other hand, to postpone, and often entirely to avoid, punishment for those whose offences, though serious, are such as may in the circumstances not call for immediate committal to prison; the power of suspension of sentence places in the hands of the commander a means of clemency and within reach of the offender an opportunity to redeem his character.

Upon review of an already suspended sentence other considerations arise. All that need be considered then is the gravity of the offence of which the person was convicted, his previous character and his conduct since conviction. As a general rule, it may be said that the more grave the offence and the worse his character before conviction, the longer is the period required to prove whether the person is honestly trying his best to redeem himself and that only acts of conspicuous merit (such as bravery or devotion to duty in action) would justify a remission of sentence without regard to the length of the period during which it had been suspended.

Apart from such special acts, remission of sentence would be justified if the offender has by his consistent good conduct really shown that he has done his utmost to retrieve his character and become a good and efficient soldier. Promotion to the higher rank should always be regarded as sufficient proof of good conduct to justify remission.

Unsatisfactory conduct subsequent to suspension will justify an order to put a suspended sentence into execution, whilst a mere negative abstention from crime would point to the advisability of directing a reconsideration of the sentence at a later date.

In considering a case, a report must always be obtained from the person's CO, which should be attached with the person's conduct sheet for future guidance.

A person under a suspended sentence is to be regarded entirely as a free man, and is to be placed under no disability whatever excepting only the liability of having his suspended sentence put into execution if he misbehaves.

- 120. Procedure when case is referred to authority or officer specified in AA.s.182. —When the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1) receives the proceedings of a court-martial containing a recommendation for the suspension of the sentence, such authority or officer will, to avoid undue delay, signal the decision to the CO concerned, who will at once issue the necessary instructions. Until instructions are received from such authority or officer, the offender cannot be committed to undergo his sentence.

- 121. Review of suspended sentences. -It is the duty of the competent military authority to review suspended sentences at intervals of not more than four months. He may in his discretion either keep a suspended sentence further suspended by ordering it to be brought forward for reconsideration on a specified date not more than four months ahead or refer the matter, if not himself the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1), to such authority or officer with a recommendation either that the offender be committed to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence or that the sentence be remitted.

- 122. Dismissal combined with suspended sentence. —If a sentence of dismissal is combined with a suspended sentence, the dismissal does not take effect until so ordered by the authority or officer specified in AA.s.182(1) (AA.s.190). If the offender is subsequently committed to undergo the unexpired portion of his sentence he should ordinarily order the dismissal to take effect as provided in AR 168. If the sentence remains suspended until it expires the dismissal, should be formally remitted under AA.s.179.

- 123. Where a person already under a suspended sentence is awarded a further sentence which is also suspended, the two sentences will run concurrently. If the further sentence is not suspended and is for a period of three months or more, the offender must also be committed on the unexpired portion of the previous (suspended) sentence, but both the sentences will run concurrently. If the further sentence is for a period of less than three months and is not suspended the previous sentence continues to be suspended subject to any order which may he passed under AA.s.186 or 187 (AA.s.188).
## CHAPTER V

### EVIDENCE

- (i) Introductory

- 1. Indian Evidence. Act applies to Court-Martial under Army Act. -The rules. of evidence for courts-martial under the AA are contained in the Indian Evidence Act.1872 (Act of 1872) (Reproduced in Part III) and in certain provisions of the AA which deal with the same subject (AA.ss.133, 134 and 140 to 144).

2.Questions to be determined at every trial.— The object of every criminal trial is or may be to determine two classes of questions— questions of fact and questions of law. If the accused person pleads guilty, there is no question of fact involved in the trial: but if he does not, he raises two questions or issues —first whether the facts charged against him happened; and next if they did happen, what is their legal consequences. In trials before courts-martial, the members of the courts both find the facts and lay down the law. It is their duty, when applying their minds to questions of fact, to consider themselves bound by the rules of evidence above referred to. In deciding questions of law, a court-martial should be guided by the advice of the JA (if one has been appointed) and should not disregard it except for very weighty reasons (AR.105).

- 3. Nature of evidence.— A member of a court-martial is supposed to bring with him to the consideration of the questions which he has to try common sense, and a general knowledge of human nature and of the ways of the world. But he is not supposed to bring with him any special knowledge enabling him to answer the particular questions of fact raised in the trial. His knowledge of these matters is derived from what is proved to him at the hearing. (But see AA.s.134 and IEA.ss.56 and 57, as to judicial notice). The means of proof, or evidence usually consists of statements made by witnesses under examination, or of documents, produced for inspection, and is, therefore, commonly classified as being either "oral evidence" or "documentary evidence". But the members of the court may. supplement by direct information the knowledge derived from these sources. Thus, they may inspect for themselves anything sufficiently identified by evidence and produced in court as material to their decision, or they may go to view any place the sight of which may help them to understand the evidence (ARs 82, 128 and 163(1)) and they are also expressly authorised to make use of their general military knowledge (AA.s.134).

- 4. Difference between judicial and non-judicial inquiries. — There is no difference in principle between the method of inquiry in judicial and extra-judicial proceedings. In either case a person who wishes to find out whether a particular event did or did not happen tries, in the first place to obtain information from persons who were present and saw what happened (direct evidence): failing that, he tries to obtain information from persons who can tell him about facts from which he can draw an inference as to whether the event did or did not happen (indirect evidence). But in judicial inquiries the information must be on oath or affirmation, and must be liable to be tested by cross-examination, and the Indian Evidence Act (IEA.s.5) by allowing evidence to be given only regarding facts which are "in issue" or "relevant" excludes particular classes of indirect evidence which an ordinary inquirer would naturally take into consideration. Statements so excluded are said to be "not admissible as evidence".

- 5. Reasons for excluding certain classes of evidence. —The answer to the question why particular statements, oral or written, should be excluded from evidence in judicial inquiries is that their exclusion has been found by practical experience useful on various grounds and notably on the following:
(a) It assists the court.

(b) It secures fair play to the accused

(c) It protects absent persons.

(d) It prevents waste of time.

It assists a court by concentrating its attention on the questions immediately before it and preventing it from being distracted or bewildered by facts which either have no bearing on the questions before it, or have so remote a bearing on those questions as to be practically useless as guides to the truth, and from being misled by statements or documents, the effect of which, through the prejudice which they excite, is out of all proportion to their true weight. It secures fair play to the accused because he comes to the trial prepared to meet a specific charge and ought not to be suddenly confronted by statements which he had no reason to expect would be made against him. It protects absent persons against statements affecting their characters. And, lastly, it prevents the infinite waste of time which would ensue if the discussion of a question of fact in a court was allowed to branch out into all the subjects with which that fact is more or less connected.

- 6. "Proved". The definitions of "proved", "disproved", and "not proved" in IEA.s.3 should be particularly noticed. These are: -
"A fact is said to be proved, when after considering the matters before it. the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that it exists. "

"Disproved" —"A fact is said to be disproved when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it does not exists. ";

"Not proved". - A Fact is Said not to be proved when it is neither proved nor disproved".

- 7. These definition to be borne in mind. Members of courts martial under the AA should hear these definitions carefully in mind when deliberating upon their findings, and they are fortunate in having so clear a guide in the performance of a most difficult duty.
- (ii) What must be proved.

- 8. Charge must be proved. "-What must be proved, in order to obtain a conviction is the particular charge brought. As a general rule, every charge alleges, or ought to allege, a specific offence constituting a breach of a specific enactment; and, subject to certain exceptions, it is of this offence, and this offence alone, that the person charged can be convicted. The reason for the rule is the unfairness of requiring a person to meet a charge for which he is not prepared. And the exceptions (AA.s.139 and Cr PC, 1973, ss. 221 and 222) will be found not to conflict with this reason, since they relate either to cases where the distinction between two offences is mainly technical or a matter of correct legal description; or to cases where the distinction is one of degree, but not of kind, and the accused, having been charged with the more serious, is allowed to be convicted of the less serious offence.

- 9. But its substance only need be proved- It is the substance only of the charge that need be proved. Allegations which are not essential to constitute the offence, and which may be omitted without affecting (he validity of the charge, do not require proof, and may be rejected as surplus age. In some cases, as in charges against a sentry for sleeping on his post, or in charges for not giving immediate notice of desertion, the time or place of the offence is material, but, as a rule it is not so. Where the Court thinks that the facts proved differ materially from the facts alleged in the particulars of the charge, but prove the same charge, it is empowered by AR 62 (4) and (5) or 121(3)and:(4), as the case may be, to record a special finding, instead of a finding of "Not Guilty".
- (iii) Arrangement of the' Indian Evidence Act

- 10. Arrangement of the Act. —The law of evidence shows how a court may lawfully be convinced that the facts alleged in the charge happened or that their happening was so probable that it may be regarded as proved. The Indian Evidence Act deals with this subject thus
(a) Part I and certain portions of Part III show what sort of facts may be proved in order to produce this conviction in the minds of the court.

(b) Part II deals with the proof of facts, that is, what sort of proof is to be given of those facts.

(c) The greater portion of Part III deals with the production of that proof, that is, who is to give it, and how it is to be given.

The Indian Evidence Act states that evidence may be given of "facts in issue" and of such other facts as are declared by it to be relevant" but of no

others. The test therefore as to the admissibility of piece of evidence is-does it state a "fact in issue" or a "relevant fact" (as defined)? If it does, it is admissible: if not. it is inadmissible.

- 11. Facts in Issue. —The facts which are ''in issue" in a criminal trial are those on which, either by themselves, or in conjunction with other facts, the existence, non-existence, nature or extent of the accused person's liability to punishment depends (IEA.s.3). For instance, A is accused of the murder of B. At his trial the following facts may be in issue:
(a) That A caused B's death:

(b) That A intended to cause B's death.

(c) That A had received grave and sudden provocation from B:

(d) That A, at the time of doing the act which caused B's death was by reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing its nature.

- (iv) Relevant Facts

12.What evidence is admissible. - We have now to consider what facts are "relevant". The Indian Evidence Act answers this question by enumerating these in the sections which make up chapter II "of the relevancy of facts". If a fact is not included In this enumeration of "relevant facts", it is inadmissible unless it is actually in issue, or its admission is specially provided for elsewhere (IEA.ss.145, 146. 148, 153, 155, 156, 157 and 158) in the Act or by some other provision of law. (e.g., the special provisions as to

evidence contained in the AA and Bankers Books Evidence Act).

- 13. Circumstantial evidence. —Facts which are relevant or which are other wise specially admitted constitute what is sometimes called "circumstantial evidence" of the fact in issue with which they are connected. From the circumstances in which crimes are ordinarily committed, it follows that the evidence of witnesses who directly saw the main 'facts in issue' happen, can rarely be obtained and that in very many cases reliance must be placed on circumstantial evidence. Such evidence is in no way inferior to direct evidence, and is in some respects superior to it; for it has become a proverb that "facts cannot lie", whilst witnesses may. On the other hand, it must always be borne in mind that if facts cannot "lie", they may, and often do, deceive; in other words, that the interpretation which they appear to suggest is often not that which ought to be placed upon them. Therefore, before the court finds an accused person guilty on circumstantial evidence, it must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with the accused having committed the act, but that they are inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused was the guilty person. In assessing the circumstantial evidence, imaginary possibilities have no place. What is to be considered is the ordinary human probabilities.

- 14. Relevant facts. —The kinds of "relevant" evidence most likely to be met with in court-martial practice will be considered in the following paragraphs

- 15. Facts forming part of one transaction.-Facts which form part of the same transaction as a fact in issue are relevant(IEA.s.6)
For example, A is accused of the murder of B by beating him. Whatever was said or done by A or B or the by standers at the beating, or so shortly before or after it as to form part of the same transaction, is a relevant fact. So also on a charge of theft, though it is not material in general to inquire into any taking of goods other than that specified in the charge, yet for the purpose of identifying the thief it may be very relevant, and therefore admissible, to show that other goods which had been left on the same premises and were stolen on the same night, were afterwards found in the possession of the accused. This is strong evidence of the accused having been near the owner's house on the night of the theft. Such evidence the section now under consideration makes relevant. Again, A is accused of waging war against the Government of India by taking part in an armed insurrection in which property is destroyed, troops are attacked, and jails broken open. The occurrence of these facts is relevant, as forming part of the general transaction, though A may not have been present at all of them.

- 16. Facts which are occasion, cause etc,of a relevant fact. Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect of a fact in issue or relevant fact or which afforded an opportunity for its occurrence are relevant (IEA.s.7).
For example, on the trial of A for robbing B, the facts that shortly before the robbery B had money in his possession and showed it publicly to third persons are relevant. Under this rule also, evidence may be given of bruises which a medical officer or other person sees next day on the body of a NCO to whom a sepoy is accused of using criminal force under AA.s.40 (a).

- 17. Facts showing motive or preparations. --Facts which show or constitute a motive or preparation for a fact in issue or relevant fact are themselves relevant as is also the conduct of accused persons and those against whom offences are committed, if such conduct is influenced by a fact in issue or relevant fact (IEA.s.8).
Complaints. —-Thus evidence may be given that, after the commission of the alleged offence, the accused absconded or was in possession of the property, or the proceeds of property, acquired by the offence, or that he attempted to conceal things which were or might have been used in committing the offence, or as to the manner in which he conducted himself when statements were made in his presence and hearing. This rule also allows evidence of a complaint made shortly after the alleged crime was committed, and of the terms in which such complaint was made, to be given in any case in which an offence against the complainant is the subject of the proceedings.

- 18. Distinction between a statement and a complaint. —A distinction is to be marked, however, between a bare statement of the fact of rape or robbery, and a complaint. The latter evidences conduct, whereas, the former has no such tendency. There may be sometimes a difficulty in discriminating between a statement and a complaint. It is conceived that the essential difference between the two is that the latter is made with a view to redress: or punishment, and must be made to someone in authority—the police for instance or a parent or some other person to whom the complainant was justly entitled to look for assistance and protection. The distinction is of importance, because while a complaint is always relevant, a statement not amounting to a complaint will only be relevant under particular circumstances e.g. if it amounts to a dying declaration or can be used as a corroborative evidence (IEA.ss.32 and 157).

- 19. Explanatory and introductory acts. -Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact are relevant, as. well as those which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact, establish the identity of a person or thing whose identity is relevant, fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened or show the relation of the parties (IEA.s.9). The facts here referred to are only relevant in so far as they are necessary for the purposes indicated.

- 20. Acts of conspirator. —In cases of conspiracy, after evidence has been given of the existence of the plot, and of the connection of the accused therewith, anything said done or written by one conspirator in reference to their common intention is a relevant fact. as against each and all of the conspirators (IEA.s.10)
Thus, on the consideration of a charge of mutiny, or exciting mutiny, evidence of (his kind may, after such prima-facie proof, be received against a particular accused. This rule admits against a conspirator everything said, done or written by a conspirator in reference to the common intention, even if said, done or written after the conspirator against whom it is offered has ceased to be connected with the conspiracy or before he joined it.

- 21. Inconsistent facts. —Facts which are inconsistent with or which, reader highly probable or improbable, a fact in issue or relevant fact are themselves relevant (IEA.s.11).
"Alibi". —This rule is of importance to the party whose object is to disprove something which is asserted by the opposite side. An 'alibi' is a familiar instance of his. If A is accused of a crime committed at CALCUTTA and he can show that he was at BOMBAY at or about the same time, his innocence is clear, while if he can even show that shortly before and after the time when the crime was committed he was so far from CALCUTTA that it was most improbable he could get there and back, a strong point in his favour would have been established.

- 22. Facts showing state of mind or body. —Facts showing the existence of any relevant state of mind or body are relevant (IEA.s.14).
Thus, where any state of mind (e.g., intention, knowledge, the absence of good faith, negligence, rashness or ill-will) is an ingredient of an offence, the commission of the principal act being either admitted or proved, evidence may for the purpose of proving the existence of such state of mind in reference to the particular matter in question, be given of similar acts committed by the accused on different occasions. Thus, although on a charge of murder or of using criminal force, evidence as to the general disposition of the accused is inadmissible, former menaces or attacks or expressions of vindictive feeling against the same person are admissible as evidence of intention.

On charges of criminal breach of trust, effected by falsifying accounts, evidence of other incorrect entries in the accused's accounts are admissible to show that particular errors covered by the actual charge were not made accidentally.

On charges of "receiving" evidence may be given that other stolen property was found at the, same time in the possession of the accused, to prove his guilty knowledge.

Upon charges of uttering forged notes. or counterfeit coin, evidence is admissible to prove the uttering on other occasions of notes or coins which were not genuine or the possession thereof.

Where the gist of the alleged offence is fraud, evidence of similar offences is admissible to prove the intent. Thus, on a charge of obtaining cash by falsely representing that the cheque given in exchange was good, in order to prove intent or knowledge, evidence is admissible as to another cheque (dishonoured on presentation) having been given to a third person.

- 23. Other instances. -In support of a charge for malicious, disrespectful or unbecoming language, addressed by word of mouth or written to or used of a superior officer at a stated time, or in a particular letter, after having proved the words in the charge, the prosecutor, to show the spirit and intention of the accused, may prove also that he spoke or wrote other disrespectful or malicious words on the same subject, either before or afterwards, or that he published or disseminated copies of the letter set forth as disrespectful in the charge. This evidence is admissible, not in aggravation of the offence charged, but for the purpose of proving the deliberate malice or disrespect imputed in the charge.

- 24. Facts showing intention. —Facts which show whether an act was intentional or accidental by indicating the existence of a series of acts of which it formed part are relevant (IEA.s.15).
This is a special case of the principle discussed above. Thus, on a charge of murder by shooting, if it is questionable whether the shooting was by accident or design, evidence may be given that at another time the accused intentionally shot at the same person. Again, on a charge of fraudulently issuing passage warrants to certain persons who were not entitled to them, after having proved that the accused had issued the warrants, evidence may be admitted of a series of similar transactions extending over a considerable period as negativing a defence that the issue of these warrants was due to a mistake on the part of the accused.

- 25. Course of business.—Facts which show a course of business according to which a fact in issue or relevant fact would naturally have been done, are relevant. For example, the question is whether a particular letter reached A. The facts that it was posted in due course, and that it was not returned through the Returned Letter Office, are relevant (IEA.s.16).
- (v) Admissions and Confessions

- 26. Rule as to admissions. —Admissions are statements made by a party to the proceedings or his representative, as to the subject matter of the case, or the facts relevant thereto (IEA.s.18). The general rule is that they may be proved against those who made them but not in their favour (IEA,s18). In connection with crime admissions usually occur in the form of confessions. The term, 'confession' is not defined in the Indian Evidence Act. It has, however, been explained by the Judicial Committee (Pakala Narayana Swami V Emperor AIR 1939 P. C.47. See also Palvinder Kaur V. State of Punjab 1953 SCR 94) that a confession must either admit in terms -the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence. The value of a confession, if true, is obviously very great, but special provision as to their receipt has been made in the Indian Evidence Act, in order to guard against torture or duress for the purpose of extorting them. Confessions are therefore only relevant subject to certain conditions. These conditions will now be considered.

27.Confession only admissible against the person who makes it. —The general rule is that a confession is not admissible as evidence against any person except the person who makes it. But a confession made by one accomplice in the presence of another is admissible against the latter to this extent, that if it implicates him, his silence under the charge may be used against him, whilst on the other hand, his prompt repudiation of the charge might tell in his favour (IEA.s.8). The Indian Evidence Act further enacts that when two or more persons are tried jointly for the same offence, a confession made by one of such persons, affecting himself and any other of the accomplices jointly tried with him, when proved, may be taken into consideration by the court against that other accomplice as well as against the person who made it (lEA.s.30. When one of several persons jointly tried pleads guilty, he ceases to be tried jointly with the others, and therefore any confession made by him cannot be taken into consideration against the others). The confession may have been made at any time and not necessarily in the presence of the accused, but the confessing person must implicate himself substantially to the same extent as the accomplice against whom the confession is taken into consideration. Though the- confession of an accomplice may thus, under certain circumstances, be "taken into consideration" and thus be an element in the consideration of the case against the other co-accused, it must necessarily be of less weight than sworn evidence, less even than the sworn evidence of an accomplice who is not jointly tried. The courts have accordingly established the following rules with regard to this kind of evidence: —

(a) Where there is absolutely no other evidence, such a confession alone will not justify the conviction of a person who is being tried, jointly with its author;

(b) The confession of co-accused must be corroborated by independent evidence, both in respect of the identity of all the persons affected by it and of the fact that the crime was committed.

- 28. Confession must be voluntary. —To be relevant and therefore admissible in evidence, a confession must be voluntary. Though it is highly desirable that the prosecutor should prove the circumstances in which a confession was made, the onus lies upon the accused of showing that a confession made by him was not voluntary and therefore irrelevant. Unless, therefore, it appears doubtful whether a confession is voluntary, a court need not require the prosecutor affirmatively to establish that fact.

- 29. What this means. —A confession is not deemed to be voluntary, if it appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise, having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority (i.e., a person engaged in the apprehension, detention, prosecution or one who is empowered to examine him) and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him to be reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage, or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him (IEA.s.24). Thus, if a hand-bill issued by the Government promising a reward and pardon to any accomplice in a certain crime who would confess was brought to the knowledge of an accomplice in the crime, who, under the influence of a hope of a pardon make a confession, that confession would not be voluntary and could not be used at his trial.

- 30. A confession does not cease to be voluntary merely because it appears to have been caused by the exhortations of a person in authority to make it as a matter of religious duty, or by an inducement collateral to the proceedings, or by inducements held out by a person having nothing to do with the apprehension, prosecution or examination of the accused.
Thus a confession made by a prisoner to a jailor in consequence of a promise by the jailor that if the prisoner confessed he would be allowed to see his wife, would be admissible in evidence.

- 31. Confession obtained by fraud etc. —It is of course, improper to endeavour to trap a man into incriminating himself; but if a confession is otherwise admissible, as evidence it does not become inadmissible merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk or because it was made in answer to questions, which he need not have answered, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make the consession, and that evidence of it might be given against him (IEA.s.29).

- 32. Confession voluntary if made after removal of impression produced by inducements etc. —A confession is deemed to be voluntary if, in the opinion of the court, it is shown to have been made after complete removal of the impression produced by any inducement, threat or promise which would otherwise render it involuntary (lEA.s.28). Thus, A is accused of a military offence, B, an officer, tries to induce A to confess by promising to get the Commanding Officer to dismiss the case with an admonition if he does so. The Commanding Officer informs B that he cannot give any such undertaking, and this is communicated to AA statement subsequently made by him is voluntary.

- 33. Confession to Police Officers.—The following provisions are important-
(a) No confession made to a police officer can be proved against a person accused of an offence (IEA.s.25).

(b) No confession made by any person whilst in the custody of a police officer, unless it be made in the immediate presence of a magistrate,can be proved against such person (.lEA.s.26).

The term 'police officer' should be construed according to its more comprehensive and popular meaning; it includes, any sort of police officer from the highest down to a village chowkidar; it also includes a military police officer (which expression includes a provost-marshal, any of his deputies or assistants, and any other person legally exercising authority under him or on his behalf).

Nevertheless, facts discovered in consequence of a confession which is itself inadmissible under (a) and (b) above, and so much of the confession as distinctly relates to the facts thereby discovered, may be proved (IEA.s.27). Thus, A, accused of house breaking by night, makes a confession to a policeman. Part of it is that A had thrown a lantern into a certain pond; the fact that he said so, and that the lantern was found in the pond in consequence, may be proved.

- 34. Whole confession must be given in evidence.—-If a confession is given in evidence, the whole of it (subject as stated in para 33) must be given, and not merely the parts disadvantageous to the accused person. It is permissible to believe one part of a confessional statement, and to disbelieve another, and it is enough that the whole of the confession is tendered in evidence so that it may be open to the court to reject the exculpatory part and to take inculpatory part into consideration, if there is other evidence to prove its correctness (Bhagwan Singh Rana vs The State of Haryana AIR 1976 SC 1797).

- 35. Confession made on oath in previous proceedings.—A confession may be used as such against the person who makes it, though it was given as evidence on oath and though the proceedings in which it was given had reference to the same subject matter as the proceedings, in which it is to be used; but if, after refusing to answer any question, the witness was compelled to answer, his answer is not admissible against him (IEA.s.132). Thus, A is charged with causing hurt to B. A had voluntarily appeared as a witness for C who was charged with the same offence at a previous trial, and had not declined to answer any question. A's evidence can be used against him on his own trial. The same rule applies to statements made by a person when charged before his commanding officer, or at the taking of summary of evidence but AR 23 (3) requires the officer recording the summary of evidence, to caution the accused before recording his statement. The proceedings of a court of inquiry cannot be used as evidence against a person subject to the AA before a court-martial, unless the court-martial is one for the trial of such person for wilfully giving false evidence before the court of inquiry (AR 182).
- (vi) Statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses.

- 36. Hearsay excluded.--As a general rule, the statements of persons not called as witnesses are inadmissible as evidence of the truth of the facts stated. This does not mean that evidence of what absent persons said is absolutely excluded. Such statements may, for instance, be admissible as part of the transaction .(IEA.s.6) as conduct influenced by it (IEA.s.8.) or as indicative of state of mind or body which are relevant (IEA.s.14). The cries of a mob led by the accused, the complaints referred to in para 17 above, and statements made by the victim in a poisoning case before his illness as to his health, and during his illness as to his symptoms, are examples of this.

- 37. Reasons for exclusion of hearsay.—The reasons for excluding "hear say" (i.e., the statements of persons not called as witnesses) are, first, that such statements are not made on oath or affirmation and secondly, that the person affected by the statement has no opportunity of cross-examining its author, The rule has often been criticized on the ground that it sometimes excludes the only means of proof obtainable, but its utility in excluding irresponsible statements, is obvious. The general rule that "hearsay is not evidence" is subject to important exceptions. Following the principle already explained, the Indian Evidence Act arranges for this by declaring that certain kinds of hearsay shall be "relevant", all other kinds, which are not mentioned being left outside its enumeration of "relevant" facts and thus made inadmissible.

- 38. Statements of absent persons which are specially admitted,—In addition to such statements as are relevant by reason of their falling under one of the heads of relevancy, already discussed, the most important of the statements thus made evidence are:—
(a)statements by persons since dead as to the cause of their death (IEA.s.32(1));

(b) Statements or entries made in the ordinary course of business (IEA.s.32(2));

(c) statements which are against the interests of their authors or which would have exposed them to a criminal prosecution or a suit for damages (lEA.s.32(3)),

The statement referred to in (a) above, is admissible in any proceeding in which the cause of the person's death comes into question and there are no conditions as to the declarant being in expectation of death or having abandoned all hope of recovery. These considerations do not therefore affect the admissibility of such evidence, though they may materially affect the weight which should be attached to it.

- 39. The statements referred to in (b) and (c) above, 'are not only admissible when the author is dead but also in cases where the author cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving evidence or when his attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense, which under the circumstances of the case, appears to the court to be unreasonable.

- 40. If such a statement or entry as is. referred to in (b) above, was made in the ordinary course of business no question as to the source of information or the time when the entry or statement was made will affect its admissibility. Further, it need not have been the declarant's duty to make them, they need not have been made contemporaneously, it is not necessary that the declarant should have had personal knowledge of the transaction recorded, and they may be used to prove independent collateral matters i.e. matters- which it was not necessary to include in the ordinary course of business.

- 41. Evidence at previous enquiry when admitted.—It may sometimes happen that a, material witness, who has given evidence at a preliminary inquiry, cannot attend at the trial. If the evidence was given in a judicial proceedings or before a person authorised by law to take it and was taken on oath or affirmation with liberty to the accused to cross-examine the Indian Evidence Act allows it to be used (IEA.s.33) at the subsequent trial of the accused on the same charge, if the witness—
(a) is dead;

(b) cannot be found:

(c) is incapable of giving evidence;

(d) is kept out of the way by the accused; or

(e) if his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, the court considers unreasonable.

- 42. This provision will sometimes admit of the evidence which was given at a court-martial which is dissolved before coming to a finding or the proceedings of which are not confirmed being used at the subsequent trial of the same accused before another court. It will also admit (subject to the above conditions) of evidence recorded before a magistrate in the presence of the accused and with liberty to cross-examine, in relation to the same charge as that on which he is afterwards tried by court-martial being used at the subsequent trial, This provision may be useful as a means of perpetuating testimony when the life of a witness is in danger, or he is under orders for active service and cannot be detained to give evidence.

- 43. Summary of evidence how far admissible.—In the case, however, of trial by court-martial there is no similar provision making a summary of evidence taken before a CO, when an accused person is remanded for trial, evidence under the circumstances as depositions taken on oath and in a judicial proceeding. Accordingly, the summary, except so far as it contains statement by the accused himself, cannot be admitted as evidence of the facts recorded in it unless the accused has pleaded guilty (ARs54, 116 and 160). But where a statement recorded in the summary is put in issue before a court-martial, as for example, where a discrepancy is alleged between that statement and the evidence given before the court, or where the alleged wilful falsehood of such a statement is made the subject of a charge, the summary if purporting to give verbatim signed statement of the witness, may be given in evidence as confirmatory of the statement having been made.

- (vii) .Statements made under special circumstances

- 44. Documents.—The rule excluding hearsay evidence is applicable to written or documentary, as well as to oral evidence. The statement of a person who is not called as a witness is nonetheless "hearsay" because it has been reduced to writing, and is offered in that form to the court. But in its application to documents of a public or official character the rule is subject to very important qualifications. In the case of many such documents the statements which they contain are, under express statutory provisions, admissible as evidence of the matters to which they relate.

- 45. Entries in books of accounts,—Thus, entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business are relevant, but such entries are not by themselves, sufficient to charge any person with a liability (IEA.s.34).

- 46. Entries in public records etc.-So also, an entry in any public or other official book, register or record made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty or by any other person in the discharge of a duty imposed on him by law, is admissible as evidence of the facts to which it relates (IEA.s.35). .Statements in maps generally offered for public sale, or made under the authority of the Central Government or any State Government are similarly admissible as evidence as to matters usually represented in such maps (IEA.s.36), as are also statements of the law of any country contained in the official publications of its Government (IEA.s.38); and a statement of any fact of a public nature, if made in a recital contained in any Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or in any Central, or State Act or in Government notification appearing in the Official Gazette is admissible as evidence of the fact (IEA.s.37).

- 47. Special provisions of AA.- Under the special provisions of the AA, enrolment papers, letters, returns and documents respecting service, dismissal or discharge, Army lists and gazettes published by authority and showing the status and rank of officers, JCOs or WQs, records in regimental books, certificates in certain cases stating the fact, date and place (but not the circumstances) of the surrender or apprehension of absentees, the reply of a Government officer to a communication addressed to him under AA.s.143 and the "return" of a commission are made evidence of the facts stated in them (AA.ss.138, 141, 142 and 143).

- 48. Judgments of Courts of law.- The judgments of courts of law are also in some cases relevant facts (IEA.ss.40 to 44). Courts-martial are chiefly interested in this matter so far as it concerns pleas in bar of trial and the proof of previous convictions. As regards the former it need only be remarked that the production of the judgment of a criminal court convicting or acquitting the accused of the same offence, or a certified copy thereof effectually bars his trial; while as to the latter, a previous conviction may be proved either by verbatim extract from the regimental books or by the production of a properly certified extract from the records of the court which convicted the accused (AA.s.144).
- (viii) Opinion of third persons, when relevant

- 49. Rules as to opinion. - The general rule is that the opinion or belief of a witness is not evidence. A witness must depose to the particular facts which he has seen, heard or otherwise observed, and it is for the court to draw the necessary inference from these facts. Thus, a witness may not on a trial for desertion characterise the accused's absence as "desertion". This is a matter of inference, and is the point which rests with the court to determine according to the evidence. The examination of the witness should be confined to the fact of the accused absenting himself, and to such other facts relevant to the charge as may be within the knowledge of the witness. In certain exceptional cases, however, opinion is for special reasons admitted as evidence. These cases are dealt with in IEA.ss.45 to 51, which following the system already explained, declare these opinions to be relevant, leaving all others outside the enumeration of the relevant facts.

- 50. Exception in, case of "experts". —The chief exception to the rule excluding opinion is that the opinion of an "expert" i.e., a person specially skilled in foreign law, in any science or art, or in the identification of handwriting or finger impressions, is admissible on any point within the range of his special knowledge (IEA.s.45).

- 51. Thus, in a poisoning case, a doctor may be asked as an expert, whether, in his opinion, a particular poison produces particular symptoms. And where unsound ness of mind is set up as a defence, an expert may be asked whether, in his opinion, the symptoms, exhibited by the accused commonly show unsoundness of mind, and whether such unsound ness of mind usually renders persons incapable of knowing the nature of their acts, or of knowing that what they do is either wrong or contrary to law. An officer may be asked, as an expert to give his opinion on a point within his special military knowledge, but to make his opinion admissible; his knowledge must be of a kind not possessed by the court generally. Thus, in a trial before the court-martial, it is not proper to ask a witness for an opinion on matters with which all officers should be familiar, but it may be perfectly proper to put questions involving opinion to an engineer as to the progress of a sap, or to an artillery officer as to the probable effect of his arm, if directed as assumed, since these matters, though having reference to military science, are not of such nature as to be presumably known to each member of a court-martial.

- 52. Grounds on which opinions are based when relevant. —When an opinion is relevant, facts which support or are inconsistent with it. and the grounds on which it is based, are also relevant (IEA.ss.46 and 51). Evidence as to the grounds on which the opinion is based can, except as mentioned in para 70 below, only be given when the author of the opinion is alive, as the grounds, on which the deceased person's opinion was based must obviously be either guess work or hearsay.

- 53. Handwriting—who may give opinion regarding it. —The opinion of any person acquainted with the handwriting of the person by whom any document is supposed to have been written or signed is relevant even though the former is not an "expert" in handwriting. A person is said to be acquainted with the handwriting of another if, —
(a) he has seen that person write;

(b) he has received documents purporting to be written by that person in answer to documents written by himself or under his authority and addressed to that person; or

(c) documents purporting to be written by that person have been habitually submitted to him in the ordinary course of business (IEA.s.47).

- 54. Proof of handwriting by comparison.—Handwriting may also be proved by comparison, under IEA.s.73. It will, therefore, be convenient to consider this section here, though it occurs in a later portion of the Act. It allows a writing admitted or proved to be written by any person to be compared with another which purports to be written by that person, in order that the genuineness of the latter may be established or rebutted. Nothing is said as to who is to make the comparison, and it may therefore be made either by the court or an expert. A combination of both methods is the safer course. A comparison of handwriting is at all times as a mode of proof hazardous and inconclusive, and especially so when it is made by one not conversant with the subject and without such guidance as might be derived from the arguments of counsel and the evidence of experts.
The same section goes on to provide that a court may require any person present in court to write any words or figures for the purpose of enabling the court to compare the words or figures so written with any words or figures alleged to have been written by such person. The comparison is, it will be noticed, made by the court in this case. It must be borne in mind that writing made for the purpose of comparison is not unlikely to be disguised.

Art 20(3) of the Constitution of India stipulates that no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. It has been held by the Supreme Court that the said Art is not violated by obtaining thumb, foot, palm or finger impressions or specimen writings of an accused person for comparison or making him show parts of his body by way of identification.

The importance of an expert's evidence in such cases lies not so much in the opinion which he expresses as in the fact that he draws the attention of the court to similarities and dissimilarities which it might not notice without his assistance, but the value of which (when pointed out) it can fully appraise for itself. Where a question of forgery is to be decided by comparison of handwritings only, the assistance of an expert is most desirable.

- 55. Other methods of proof. —The methods referred to above are the usual ones by which an individual's authorship of a document is proved. They are not, however, the only ones, and in addition to the writer's own admission, or the evidence of someone who saw him write it, the authorship of a document may be proved by circumstantial evidence. For instance, A, whose credit is unimpeachable, is able to swear that B was the sole occupant of the room, and that as soon as B left it, he (A) entered and found a letter, with the ink still wet, lying on the table. There could be no more convincing proof that B wrote the letter, however unlike his original penmanship the writing might be. Again, the writing of an anonymous letter is the subject of a court-martial charge. Circumstances directing suspicion to a particular regiment, company or class have come to light and specimens of the handwriting of all suspected persons have been procured from the regimental school or otherwise. One of these corresponds with the writing of the anonymous letter. It has been held that IEA.s.73 can be invoked where the document in issue is alleged by the prosecution to have been written by that particular person, such allegation being based on the resemblance of the handwriting to that of other documents admitted or proved to have been written by that person. The opinions of one or more experts as to the letter and specimen being by the same writer and evidence as to the authorship of specimen are, however, relevant (lEA.ss.45 and 11) and from them the authorship of the anonymous letter may be inferred.

- 56. Summary of law as to proof of authorship of document. —The result of the foregoing remarks is that the authorship of a document may be proved by-
(a) the evidence of experts (para 50);

(b) the evidence of persons acquainted with the handwriting of the alleged writer (para.53);

(c) comparison under IEA.s.73 (para 54);

(d) the admission of the writer or the evidence of someone who saw him write it (para.55); and

(e) circumstantial evidence (para.55).

- 57. Evidence of belief not excluded. —The rule which requires a witness to state what he knows, and not what he thinks does not require him to depose to facts with an expression of certainty that excludes all doubt in his mind. For example, it is the constant practice to receive in evidence a witness' belief as to the identity of a person or thing or as to the fact of a certain handwriting being the handwriting of a particular person, though he will not swear positively to those facts. A witness who falsely swears that he "believes" a thing to be so and so is as much guilty of giving of false evidence as one who falsely swears that "it is" so and so.

- 58. Opinion as to conduct how far admissible. —In cases affecting the conduct of the accused, either as to deportment or language, it is not only proper,but often necessary, to require a witness to declare his opinion, because that opinion may be an impression derived from a combination of circumstances occurring at the time referred to, which it would be difficult, if not impossible, fully to impart to the court. But it would be improper to draw the attention of a witness to facts, whether stated by him or by another witness, and to ask his opinion as to their accordance with military discipline or usage, because the courts, when in possession of facts, are the only proper judges of their tendency. If the witness is asked a question inviting him to express his opinion as to the general conduct of the person accused, or to give his judgment on the whole matter of the charge, he may, and should, decline to answer it.
- (ix) Character, when relevant

- 59. Evidence of character when admissible.-In criminal proceedings (which term includes trials by court-martial) the fact that the accused is of good character is always relevant (IEA.s.53),but the fact that he has a bad character is irrelevant unless evidence has been given that he has a good character (IEA.s.54). "Character" includes both reputation and disposition, but evidence may be given only of general reputation and general disposition, and not of particular acts by which reputation and general disposition, were shown (IEA.s.55explanation); as an exception,, however, to this, previous convictions can be proved as evidence of bad character, when such evidence is otherwise admissible i.e., when evidence of good character has been given (IEA.s.54 explanation 2).

- 60. Evidence of character etc.,after conviction. —By a special provision of the AA (AA.s.144), evidence of character (good or bad) previous convictions and certain other prescribed matters, information on which is necessary to enable the court to decide upon its sentence, is admitted after the accused has been convicted, while at a SCM the officer holding the trial may record such matters of his own knowledge. With these exceptions, no unfavourable evidence as to character is admissible unless the accused has brought it on himself by calling or eliciting evidence of his good character.

- 61. Effect of Evidence as to character. —Evidence of general good character cannot avail the accused against evidence of the fact, but where some reasonable doubt exists as to his guilt, it may tend to strengthen a presumption of innocence, and proved good character should be taken into consideration with all the other facts and circumstances, not as positive evidence contradicting any that has been brought on the other side, but as probable testimony to induce the court to doubt whether the other evidence is correct, and not to discard that evidence if the court thinks that it is correct.
On a charge of theft, character for honesty may be entitled to considerable weight; so also on a charge implicating the courage of a person, character for bravery and resolution. But it would be manifestly absurd, on a charge of theft to allow character for bravery to weigh heavily or on a charge of cowardice, to be biased by a character for honesty. General character, unconnected with the charge, though it may not weigh with the court, except in awarding punishment in discretionary cases, may essentially serve the accused by influencing the superior with whom it rests to mitigate or remit the sentence.

- 62. Evidence tending to show disposition not admissible-As a general rule, it is not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those included in the charge against him for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that he is a person likely from his conduct or character or disposition to have committed the offence for which he is being tried. Thus, on a charge of murder, the prosecutor cannot give evidence of the conduct of the accused in respect of other persons for the purpose of proving a blood-thirsty and murderous disposition. On a charge against a sentry of having been asleep on his post on an occasion, evidence that he had been found asleep on his post on other occasions would not be admissible for the purpose of showing that he would be likely to commit the offence; and on a charge of insubordination, evidence of insubordinate conduct on other occasions would not be admissible for the purpose of showing a tendency to insubordinate conduct. Evidence as to other crimes committed by the accused may however be admissible under paras 15, 22 or 24 above, if these crimes form part of the same transaction, show the existence of a relevant state of mind or body or negative the theory of accident or misfortune.
- 63. Conclusion of list of "relevant facts", —This concludes the list of what the Indian Evidence Act classes as "relevant" facts. Special provision is, however, made elsewhere for the admission of certain other evidence, a consideration of which may be helpful to a court in arriving at a decision as to how far a witness is to be believed. These are: —
(a) Answers to certain questions which are admissible on cross-examination;

(b) Evidence impeaching the credit of witnesses:

(c) Corroboration of the statements of witnesses. They will be considered later, when dealing with the portions of the Indian Evidence Act in which they occur.

- (x) Facts which need not be proved

- 64. Two categories of facts which need not be proved. —Having thus settled what sort of facts may be proved, the Indian Evidence Act goes on to show how these facts are to be brought to the notice of the court which tries a case. In the first place, certain facts need not be proved at all. These fall into two categories viz., facts of which courts take judicial notice, and admissions.

- 65. Judicial notice. —A court is said to lake judicial notice, in other words, not to require evidence, of any facts which are assumed to be so generally known as not to require special proof. By AA,s.134 a court-martial is expressly authorised to take judicial notice of all matters within the general military knowledge of its members. Thus, evidence need not be given as to the relative rank of officers, as to general duties, authorities, and obligations of different members of the service, or generally as to any matters which an officer, as such, may reasonably be expected to know. The Indian Evidence Act further requires courts to take judicial notice of certain other matters. Among these are: all laws in force in the territory of India, all public Acts passed by Parliament of the United Kingdom, Articles of War for the Indian Army, Navy or Air Force the course of proceedings of Parliament and of the legislature in a Province or State, the accession and the sign manual of the Sovereign for the time being of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, all seals of which English Courts take judicial notice, the seals of all the courts in India. The seals of any Notary Public, the existence, title and national flag of a State or sovereign recognised by the Government of India, the divisions of time, the geographical divisions of the world, the commencement, continuance and termination of hostilities between the Government of India and any other State or body of persons and the rule of the road on land or at sea (IEA.s.57).

- 66. Books of reference may be consulted—In all those cases, and also on all matters of public history, literature, science or art, the court may consult appropriate books of reference and may require the party asking it to take judicial notice of a fact to produce such a book, before it takes judicial notice of the fact (IEA.s.57).

- 67. Facts admitted —Facts which the parties admit in court need not be proved, otherwise than by such admissions, unless the court requires them to be so proved (IEA.s.58). It is the practice of courts-martial to receive admissions made in open court as to collateral or comparatively unimportant facts which are not in dispute, but must be proved on the part either of the prosecution or of the defence. Thus, it is the practice of allowing either party the option of admitting the authenticity of orders or letters or the signature of document, or the truth of a copy, put in by the other party, in cases where such writings are receivable when proved; or that certain details in an enumeration of stores or in an account are correctly stated; or that a promise or permission to a certain effect was actually given, or that a certain letter was sent or received on a given day; and so in similar cases where admissions may expedite the proceedings and do not go to the merits of the matter before the court.

- 68. Plea of guilty. The commonest instance of an admission is a plea of guilty, which is an admission by the accused of all the averments in the charge sheet. On such plea, no further evidence of the guilt of the accused is necessary and he can be convicted and sentenced accordingly.
- (xi) Oral evidence

- 69. Oral evidence defined. —All other facts must be proved by oral or documentary evidence. 'Oral evidence' means statements made to the court by witnesses, while 'documentary evidence' means the production of documents for the inspection of the court (IEA.s.3). All facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence (IEA.s.59) which in all cases must be direct; that is to say. —
(a) if it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw it;

(b) if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard it;

(c) if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or In any other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner;

(d) if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.

- 70. Special rule as to treatises by experts. —The opinions, however, of experts expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale, and the grounds on which such opinions arc held, may be proved by the production of such treatise if the author is dead, or cannot be found, or has become incapable of giving evidence or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as unreasonable (Proviso I to IEA.s.60).

- 71. Court may require production of things referred to. —If oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing, other than a document, the court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of such material thing for its inspection (Proviso 2 to IEA.s.60).
- (xii) Documentary evidence

- 72. Rule as to documentary evidence. —The existence, condition, or contents of a public document may be proved either by primary or by secondary evidence (IEA.ss.61, 64 and 65(e)). The existence, condition or contents of a private document may be proved by primary evidence, and in certain circumstances may also be proved by secondary evidence (IEA.ss.61, 64 and 65(a) to (d)(f) and (g)).It should be remembered that 'contents' of a document and not the 'truth' of these contents is here referred to. A document is, as a rule, only proof that certain marks have been made on the paper, or whatever it is on which they are inscribed, e.g., that a certain statement has been written down. It is only in exceptional cases that a document is proof of the matters recorded; these cases are dealt with separately.
In all cases, the document must be produced by a witness on oath or affirmation.

- 73. Primary evidence. —Primary evidence is the production of the document itself for the inspection of the court, or, if it is one of a number of documents produced by a uniform process (e.g., printing, lithography or photography) the production of one of them (IEA.s.62). If, however, a number of documents so produced are copies of a common original, they are not primary evidence of the original. For example, the type of a book is set up from the author's manuscript and a number of copies printed. Every copy is primary evidence of the contents of the others, but not of the contents of the manuscript (IEA.s.62- Explanation 2).

74.Secondary evidence, when given.—Secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition or contents of a document (IEA.s.65) in the following cases: —

(a) When the original is shown or appears to be in the possession or power of—

- (i) the opposite party; or
- (ii) any person out of reach of, or not subject to, the process of the court; or
- (iii) any person legally bound to produce it, and when, after due notice (see IEA.s.66) such person does not produce it,
any kind of secondary evidence (see para 75 below) may be given.

(b) When the existence etc., of the original has been admitted in writing by the party against whom it is to be proved, the written admission is admissible as secondary evidence.

(c) When the original has been destroyed or lost, or when the party offering evidence of its contents, cannot, for any other reason not arising from his own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable time, any kind of secondary evidence (see para 75 below) may be given.

(d) When the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable, any kind of secondary evidence (see para 75 below) may be given.

(e) When the original is a public document or document of which certified copy is permitted by law to be used as evidence (e.g., the Bankers' Book Evidence Act, 1891 (XVIII of 1891)), in such cases a certified copy is the only secondary evidence permissible.

(f) When the originals consist of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot conveniently be examined in court, and the fact to be proved is the general result of the whole collection, evidence may be given as to such general result by any person who has examined them, and who is skilled in the examination of such documents.

- 75. Secondary Evidence, nature. —Besides certified copies (see sub-para (e)of the preceding para) secondary evidence of a private document given at a court-martial will generally take one of the following forms (IEA.s.63): —
(a) Copies made from the original by a mechanical process which ensures accuracy (e.g., photography) and copies compared with such copies.

(b) Copies made from or compared with the original.

(c) Oral accounts of the contents of a document given by persons who have seen it.

- 76. Public documents defined—The following are "public documents" (IEA.s.74): —
(a) Documents forming the acts or records of the acts—

- (i) of the sovereign authority.
(ii)of official bodies and tribunals, and

- (iii) of public officers.
(b) Public records kept in any State of private documents (IEA.s.74).

Private documents defined.—All other documents are private (IEA.s.75). As mentioned above secondary evidence can always be given of the contents of a public document. The nature of the secondary evidence varies with the character of the documents, the most usual kind being a "certified copy" (IEA.s.76), and if the document is one provable by a ''certified copy", this is the only secondary evidence admissible (IEA.s.65). The secondary evidence required to prove the various kinds of public documents is dealt with in IEA.ss.76 to 78, which should be consulted, if necessary. The public documents specified in IEA.s.78 are provable as therein stated, all others are provable by "certified copies" as provided for in IEAs.76 and 77.

77.Provisions as to extracts and copies of certain document. —Under the special provisions of the AA, extracts from or copies of official records are in certain cases made admissible as evidence (AA.ss.141, 142 and 144) while under the general law referred to above (IEA.s.78) Acts, orders and notifications of the Central Government in any of its departments or of any Local Government or any department of any Local Government are provable by the records of the departments certified by the heads of those departments respectively or by any document purporting to be printed by order of any such Government.

- (xiii) Presumption as to documents

- 78. ''shall presume' and ''may presume". —IEA.ss.79 to 90 provide that certain documents shall be presumed to be what they purport to be, unless and until the contrary is proved, and that, as to certain others, courts may in their discretion, either make a similar presumption or require the genuineness of the document to be proved by the party who puts it forward. The distinction between what the courts 'shall presume' and what they 'may presume' should be noticed (IEA.s.4). An instance of the former class of presumption is found in AA.s.140, which provides that certain signatures shall be presumed to be genuine until the contrary is shown. An instance of the latter is that regarding telegraph messages contained in the Indian Evidence Act (IEA.s.88). A court may either presume that a message forwarded from a telegraph office to the addressee corresponds with a message delivered for transmission at the office of origin or may require that fact to be proved by the party asserting it. This provision, does not, however, authorise the court to make any presumption as to who delivered the message for transmission or as to the truth of its contents.

- 79. Contract etc., rule as to. —Where a contract, grant or other disposition of property is reduced to the form of a document, the document itself (or secondary evidence of its contents when ad missile) is, save in certain exceptional cases, the only admissible evidence of the matter which it contains, and the written contract cannot therefore,save as aforesaid, be varied by verbal explanations or additions (IEA.s.91).
- (xiv) Of the burden of proof

- 80. Burden of proof.—The burden of providing the existence (or non-existence) of any fact lies on the side which wishes the court to believe in its existence or non-existence, as the case may be, and which would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side (IEA.ss.102 and 103). In criminal trials the effect of this is that the burden of proof is, in the first instance, on the prosecutor, or as it is sometimes expressed "every man is presumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty". An exception to this rule is that, when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him (IEA.s.106) e.g., in charges for being "out of bounds" without a pass, leaving a post without orders, releasing a prisoner without authority, absence without leave etc. In such cases, the main fact being proved, the burden of proving the possession of a pass, leave etc., lies on the accused, and such evidence as the prosecutor may be in a position to give—including inferences from the conduct of the accused—may be accepted as justifying a conviction in the absence of an explanation by the accused.

- 81. Rule as to general and special exceptions. —When any person is accused of an offence, the burden of proving the existence of facts bringing the case within any of the "general exceptions" of the Indian Penal Code or any special exception or proviso applicable to the particular offence is on the accused (IEA.s.105). For instance, A is accused of murdering B. The burden of proving that A killed B is on the prosecution. A, however, pleads grave and sudden provocation; the burden of proving this provocation is on A.
Difference in discharge of burden in cases of prosecution and defence. —When the burden of the issue is on the prosecution e.g., the onus of proving the guilt, it must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. It rests throughout on the prosecution and that onus never shifts. When, however, the burden of an issue is upon the accused, he is not, in general, required to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt or in default incur a verdict of guilty. It is sufficient if he succeeds in proving a prima facie case. The test is not whether the accused has proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that he comes within the exception, but whether a reasonable doubt is thrown on the guilt of the accused.

82.Presumptions.—In certain cases the burden of proof is determined, not by the relation of the parties to the question, but by what are called "presumptions". Certain presumptions have been discussed already in connection with documents and IEA.s.114 further provides that a court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business. An instance of such a presumption is that a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft may be presumed to be either the thief or a guilty receiver unless he can account for his possession.

In some cases a state of mind (e.g.,intention, knowledge) is an ingredient of the offence, but a state of mind is not capable of positive proof; it can only be inferred from overt acts, which when proved, raises a presumption of intention or knowledge. As a general rule, a person is presumed in law to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his act.

83."Shifting" of the burden of proof.—Where the prosecution have proved a prima facie case, the burden of disproving any facts or presumptions raised by the prosecution lies on the accused. It is not infrequently said that the burden of proof "shifts" on to the accused, but this is not, strictly speaking, correct be cause an accused person is not bound to make any defence and will not necessarily be convicted if he makes no defence. For instance, A is accused of committing theft of a five-rupee note, and the prosecution prove that immediately after its loss it was found in A's possession. There is obviously a strong presumption that A committed theft of the note, and as a matter of common sense, the court would almost certainly convict him, if he offered no explanation (or no reasonable explanation). Still, in law the burden remains on the prosecution to the end, and does not 'shift' to the accused.

- (xv) Witnesses

- 84. Competency of witnesses. —Under law all persons are competent witnesses unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to these questions, by reason of (IEA.s.118): -
(a) tender years,

(b) extreme old age,

(c) disease of mind or body, or

(d) any other cause of the same kind.

- 85. Vide Cr PC, 1973, s. 315(1), an accused person is a competent witness for the defence and may give evidence on oath in disproof of the charges against him or any person jointly tried with him. He cannot, however, be compelled to give evidence. His failure to give evidence cannot be made the subject of any comment before the court, nor can it give rise to any presumption against him. Under the AA, however, the accused person is not competent to give evidence on oath but may make an unsworn statement in his defence (ARs 58, 59, 118 and 159).

- 86. Accused cannot give evidence but may make a statement. —Since the accused cannot give evidence on oath under the AA, an unsworn statement made by him in his defence (ARs 58, 59, 118 and 159) may be given a greater or lesser degree of credence by the court and is one of the "matters before it", which the court is bound to consider when arriving at a decision as to whether the charge is "proved" or "not proved'

- 87. Persons jointly tried cannot give evidence.—Persons jointly tried are incompetent to testify against each other. If, therefore, the prosecution find it necessary to call one participator in a crime as a witness against the others, the proper course is not to arraign him with them, or (if he has been no arraigned) to offer no evidence and take a verdict of acquittal.
If an accused thinks that the evidence of a person whom it is proposed to try with him is material to his defence, he should claim a separate trial (AR 35(4)).

- 88. Evidence of accomplice.—The evidence of an accomplice is admissible against his principal, and vice versa, unless they are tried together, but the evidence of an accomplice should always be received with great caution. No particular number of witnesses is legally necessary to prove any fact (IEA.s.134) and the uncorroborated evidence even of an accomplice is, therefore, in strict law sufficient (IEA.s.133) if the court considers him credible, but a court-martial should very carefully consider the danger of convicting the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice; and if there is a JA it is his duty to warn the court of the danger, though at the same time pointing out that it is within its legal province to convict upon such evidence if it so chooses. The corroboration required is independent testimony which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed but also that the accused committed it.

- 89. Deaf or dumb witnesses. —A witness who is unable to speak may give his evidence in any other manner in which he can make it intelligible, as by writing or by signs; but such writing or signs must be made in open court. Evidence so given is deemed to be oral evidence (IEA,s.119). The same rule would, no doubt, apply to a deaf or deaf and dumb witness, who might be communicated with by writing or signs provided the court was satisfied with the reality and accuracy of such communication.

- 90. Member as witness. —A member of a court-martial is a competent witness in favour of the accused, and might, as such be sworn or affirmed to give evidence at any stage of the proceedings; but AR39(2) directs, that a witness for the prosecution shall not sit on a court-martial for the trial of any person against whom he is a witness.
- (xvi) Privilege of witnesses

91.Incriminating questions. —It by no means follows that, because a person is competent to give evidence, he is compelled to answer every question he may be asked when giving evidence. A witness on being put a question, the answer to which would incriminate him, is entitled to ask to be excused from answering it, and if after he has asked to be excused; the court compels him to answer (as it is entitled to) his answer cannot be proved against him at any criminal proceedings, except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such answer (IEA.s.132).

- 92. Official matters. —Another class of. privilege is based on considerations of public policy. No one is permitted to give evidence derived from unpublished official records relating to any affairs of State, except with the permission of the head of the department concerned (IEA.s.123). Regs Army para 320. No public officer can be compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence, if he considers such disclosure injurious to the public interests (IEA.s.124) and in particular no magistrate or police officer can be compelled to state whence he got any information as to the commission of any offence (IEA.s.125).

93.Confidential reports.—On this principle, a confidential report, or letter or official information of a confidential character, although it may refer to matters which a court-martial may have decided to be relevant to the inquiry before it, cannot be produced or disclosed except by consent of the superior authority,and this consent is refused if the production or disclosure is considered detrimental to the public service. Proof of the refusal should be laid before the court by the examination of a witness or by written communication, read in open court and attached to the proceedings.

- 94. Courts of inquiry. —So also, the proceedings of a court of inquiry cannot be called for by courts-martial, nor witnesses examined as to their contents; nor is any confession or statement made at a court of inquiry admissible against an accused before a court-martial (AR 182). The only exception to this rule is in the case of a court-martial for giving false evidence before the court of inquiry.

- 95. Privilege which cannot be waived.—The modified privilege referred to in para 91 is the privilege of a witness and he may waive it, and answer (without being compelled to do so) if he chooses, but the privilege referred to in the following paragraphs is for the protection of other parties and cannot be waived except with their consent.

- 96. Communication during marriage. —A husband must not be compelled to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during the marriage, and a wife must not be compelled to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during the marriage (IEA.s.122).

- 97. Legal advisers-communication to. —A legal adviser is not permitted, whether during or after the termination of his employment as such, unless with his client's express consent, to disclose any communication, oral or documentary, made to him as such legal adviser, by or on behalf of his client, during, in the course of, and for the purpose of his employment, or to disclose any advice given by him to his client during, in the course of and for the purpose of such employment. But this protection does not extend to—
(a) any such communication if made in the furtherance of any illegal purpose;

(b) any fact observed by the legal adviser in the course of his employment as such, showing that any crime or fraud has been committed since the commencement of his employment, whether his attention was directed to such fact by or on behalf of his client or not; or

(c) any fact with which the legal adviser became acquainted otherwise than in his character as such.

The expression "legal adviser" includes the clerks of legal advisers and interpreters between them and their clients, and the person representing or assisting the accused during trial before a court-martial (IEA,ss.126 and 127).

- 98. Procedure when privilege claimed. —The questions, whether answered or not, should be entered on the proceedings. When a witness claims the privilege of not answering, it is (except as mentioned in para 92 above) for the court to decide whether the question is within any of the exceptions. Courts-martial should in practice, interpose by informing a witness, at the time when a question is put to him, that he is not bound to answer. Any such interposition, and any claim of privilege by the witness, and the fact whether the witness is required to answer or not, should be noted on the proceedings.
- (xvii) Of the examination of witnesses

99.Points requiring attention of court. —It will be the duty of the court in every case to see that the rules of evidence are strictly conformed to. The following points will require special attention in relation to any evidence that may be tendered: —

(a) That it relates to a "fact in issue" or "relevant fact''.

(b) That it is not within the rule rejecting hearsay evidence.

(c)That (except in the case of experts) it is not a mere expression of opinion.

(d) That, if it is a confession or admission, it is legally admissible.

(e) That, if it is a document, it is legally admissible and properly put in evidence. (A document is said to be "put in" when it is produced to the court by a witness on oath or affirmation).

(f) That no document or other thing. is used for the purposes of the trial which has not been properly put in. (On a charge of theft, the articles, the subject of the charge, must be produced and identified in the presence of the court, by witnesses or their absence satisfactorily accounted for. For purposes of identification a document or thing may, however, be shown to a witness before it has been formally proved and put in. )

(g) That any witnesses called are legally competent to give evidence.

(h) That any document with which a witness proposes to refresh his memory is legally admissible for the purpose.

- (i) That the examination of witnesses is fairly and properly conducted.

- 100. How examination of witnesses is conducted.—The points mentioned in (a) to (g) above have been already considered and (h) will be noticed later. The Indian Evidence Act deals with the point at (i) above as shown in the following paragraphs.
The examination of a witness by the person who calls him is called his examination-in-chief; and on this examination the questions must relate to the matters in issue at the trial or relevant to the issue. The court must, of course, in all cases see that a witness is not compelled to answer any question in respect of which he is entitled to claim privilege, and they must also see that, as far as possible, a witness is so dealt with that his honest belief is obtained from him.

101.Leading questions. —Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in examination-in-chief or in re-examination, except with the permission of the court (IEA. s.142). Leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed or which the court considers already sufficiently proved are, however, permitted (IEA.s.142), and the court may also allow leading questions to be put to a "hostile witness" (IEA.s.154). A leading question is one suggesting the answer which the person putting the question wishes or expects to receive (IEA.s.141). For instance, a witness must not be asked "Did the accused then go into the barrack room?" but "What did the accused do next?". If it were not for this rule a favourable and dishonest witness might be led to give any evidence that is desired. It would, of course, be mere waste of time to enforce the rule where the questions asked are simply introductory and form no part of the real substance of inquiry, or where they relate to matters which, though material, are not disputed. But where a question relates to a contested point, which is either directly conclusive of the matter in issue, or directly and proximately connected with it, the rule should be strictly enforced, and no question should be allowed in a form which directly or indirectly suggests to the witness the answer desired, or which, embodying a material fact, admits of a conclusive answer by a simple "yes" or "no".

- 102. Test of what are leading questions.—Care must, however, be taken in enforcing this rule not to exclude questions which do not really suggest an answer, but merely direct the attention of the witness to the subject as to which he is questioned. It is often, indeed, extremely difficult in practice to determine whether or not a question is in a leading form, and in all such cases the real test should be whether or not the examination is being conducted fairly and with the object of eliciting the honest belief of the witness.

- 103. Rules as to directing attention to articles.—When any article, such as a stick, belt, or document, is produced in court for the purpose of identification, the witnesses may be asked such question as "whether he recognises it" and whether he saw anything done with it, or to it"; but such a question as "whether he saw A strike B with the stick or belt" or "whether he saw A make an alteration in the document", should not be admitted.

- 104. Hostile witness. —The court may, in its discretion, permit the person who calls a witness to put any questions to him which the adverse party might put in cross-examination (IEA.s.154). This is called the treating of a witness as "hostile". If a person calls a witness and the witness appears to be directly hostile to him or interested on the other side, or unwilling to give evidence, the reason of the rule forbidding leading questions fails, and the court may allow the person calling the witness not only to ask him leading questions, but to cross-examine him, and to treat him in every respect as though he were a witness called by the other side. In such circumstances he can, therefore, be asked questions tending to show his bad character, and his credit may be impeached in the same way as that of a witness called by the adverse party.

- 105. Rules as to cross-examination. —When the examination-in-chief is finished the opposite party cross-examines the witness. In cross-examination leading questions may be put and also questions, otherwise irrelevant, which tend—
(a") to test his veracity;

(b) to discover who he is and what is his position in life; or

(c) to shake his credit by injuring his character (IEA.s.146).

- 106. A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced to writing without such writing being shown to him, but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing his attention must be called to it before it can be proved (IEA.s.145). It is often important that when a witness is under cross-examination as to his previous statements, the fact of their having been reduced to writing should be concealed from him. It is only reasonable, however, that, when he has given his answer, he should be shown the document and have the chance of correcting himself. The summary of evidence may be used to prove any statement which the witness made, and which it is proposed to contradict, and evidence may be called to prove that the evidence of a witness, though consistent with the summary, is not consistent with evidence given by him at the investigation before the CO.
- 107. Questions which assume that facts have been proved which have not been proved, or that answers have been given which in fact have not been given, are improper, and should not be allowed even in cross-examination. Nor should a witness be pressed in cross-examination as to any facts, which, if admitted, would not affect the matter at issue or his credibility. If the person cross-examining intends to adduce evidence contradicting the evidence given by the witness, he should put to the witness in cross-examination the substance of the evidence which he proposes to adduce, in order to give him an opportunity of retracing or explaining what he has said.

- 108. A witness under cross-examination may be asked any questions which tend to test his veracity, discover who he is, or shake his credit by injuring his character. But a witness may, of course, decline to answer a question as to which he is entitled to claim privilege, and the right of asking questions tending merely to discredit is qualified by IEA.s.148, which provides that when a question which is only relevant as affecting his credit by injuring his character is put to a witness, the court shall decide as to whether or not he shall be compelled to answer it, and that in exercising this discretion the court shall have regard to the following considerations: —
(a) Injurious questions. —Such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies.

(b) Such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to matters so remote in time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in a slight degree, the opinion of (he court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies.

(c) Such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness's character and the importance of his evidence.

(d) The court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the witness's refusal to answer the inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.

109.Exclusion at evidence to contradict answers to questions testing veracity, etc.—It is further provided that when a witness has been asked, and has answered such a question no evidence can be given to contradict his answer (IEA.s.153). This rule is however subject to the following two exceptions: —

(a) When the witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted and denies it, evidence of his previous conviction may be given.

(b) When he is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality and answers it by

denying the facts suggested, proof may be given of the truth of these facts.

- 110. Impeaching credit of witnesses—The credit of a witness may be impeached by the adverse party, or with the consent of the court by the party who calls him, by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit (IEA.s.155(1)).Such persons may not, on their examination-in-chief, give reasons for their belief, but may be asked their reasons in cross-examination, and their answers cannot be contradicted. When the credit of a witness is so impeached, the party who called the witness may give evidence in reply to show that he is worthy of credit.

111.The credit of a witness may also, under similar conditions, be impeached by proof that he has been bribed, or by proof of former statements inconsistent, with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted, and, at trials for rape or an attempt to ravish, it may also be shown that the woman against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed was of general immoral character (lEA.s.155(2), (3) and (4)).

- 112. Corroboration of witnesses. —In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness as to a relevant fact he may be asked questions as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near the time or place at which that fact occurred IEA.s.156). Thus, 'A' an accomplice gives an account of a robbery in which he took part. He describes various incidents unconnected with the robbery which occurred on his way to and from the place where it was committed. Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order to corroborate his evidence as to the robbery itself.

113.Former statements by witnesses.—In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statements made by such witness relating to the same fact: —

(a) to any one at or about the time when the fact took place; or

(b) at any time before the authority legally competent to investigate the fact;

may be proved (IEA.s.157). The above conditions are, to some extent, a safeguard against fictitious statements designedly made to support subsequent evidence, but it is obvious that the corroborative value of such statements depends on the circumstances of each case, and that they may easily be entirely valueless. The mere fact of a person having, on a previous occasion, made the same assertion, often adds but little to the chances of its truthfulness, and the courts should distinguish such testimony from really corroborative evidence.

- 114. Re-examination. —At the conclusion of the cross-examination of a witness the person who called him may, if he pleases, re-examine him; but the re-examination must be directed exclusively to. the explanation of matters referred to in cross-examination. If a new matter is, by permission of the court, introduced in re-examination, the other side may further cross-examine upon it (lEA.s.138).

- 115. Questions by court. —After the re-examination of a witness is closed, the court often asks him questions to clear up some point which it regards as material.
Frequently, too, the court recalls a witness, or allows him to be recalled for further examination; and sometimes it even calls and examines a witness who has not been called by either party. In any of these cases the party affected by the answers should be allowed to suggest further questions or to cross-examine (as the case may require).

If a witness is so called or recalled after the case for the accused is closed, the accused should also be allowed to give further evidence in rebuttal, and to comment upon the fresh evidence if he has already made his address (ARs 142 and 143).

The court may allow the prosecution to call further evidence, after the case for the defence is closed, to contradict or qualify the evidence given by the defence witnesses, including the statement made by the accused, in the following cases (ARs 143 (2) and (3)): —

(a) Where the defence have introduced new matter which the prosecution could not have foreseen.

(b) When the prosecution had evidence available which was inadmissible, because it was irrelevant until a particular defence was raised e.g., to rebut the plea of alibi.

(c)To contradict evidence of good character given by the defence.

116.Refreshing memory.—A witness may not read his evidence or refer to notes of evidence already given by him; but he may, while under examination, refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by him at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory. He may also refer to any such writing made by another person, but read by himself within the time aforesaid if, when he read it, he knew it to be correct. Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may, if the court is satisfied that there is sufficient reason for the non-production of the original, be permitted to refer to a copy of such document. An expert may also refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises (IEA.s.159). Any writing referred to under the provisions of this paragraph must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he required it, and that party may, if he

pleases cross-examine the witness upon it (IEA.s.161).

- 117. Notes referred to are not evidence of themselves. —But a witness who refreshes his memory by reference to writing must always swear positively as to the fact, or that he has a perfect recollection that the fact was truly stated in. the memorandum or entry at the time it was written (IEA.s.160). If on referring to a memorandum not made by himself he can neither recollect the fact nor recall his conviction as to the truth of the account or writing when the facts were fresh in his memory, so that he cannot speak as to the fact further than as finding it noted in a written entry, his testimony is objectionable, as being hearsay.
- (xviii) Conclusion

- 118. Rule as to evidence improperly received or rejected. —The Indian Evidence Act concludes by providing that the improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for invalidating a trial if it appears that, independently of the evidence improperly admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision of the court, or that, if the rejected evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision (IEA.s.167). This provision, while not excusing a court which contravened the law, will often prevent a miscarriage of justice where the improper admission or rejection of evidence does not really affect the merits of the case.

- 119. How to act when in doubt.—If a member of a court-martial is in doubt whether a statement or document which it is proposed to be put before him is, or is not, admissible as evidence, the most useful advice that can be given to him is, first to use his common sense as to whether the matter proposed to be proved has any practical bearing on the question which he has to try, and, if he thinks that it has, then to consider whether its admission is excluded by any provision of the Indian Evidence Act e.g., as being hearsay. He should remember that the enumeration of relevant facts in the Indian' Evidence Act is so wide that admissibility is the rule and exclusion the exception.

##### CHAPTER VI

### CIVIL OFFENCES

- 1. Definition of civil offence, and jurisdiction of courts-martial over civil offence. —Civil offence for the purposes of AA means an offence which is triable by a criminal court (AA.s.3(ii)).
Courts-martial are prohibited from trying cases of murder or culpable homicide of a person not subject to military, naval or air force law or cases of rape in relation to such a person, unless the offence is committed on active service or at a specified frontier post or at any place outside India.

Subject to the above exceptions a court-martial can try all civil offences committed by a person subject to AA. (AA.ss.69 and 70).

2.Concurrent jurisdiction.—A criminal court and a court-martial may each have jurisdiction in respect of the same offence. Adjustment of jurisdiction is provided for by AA.ss.125 and 126, which give the military authorities the right of deciding by which court the alleged offender is to be tried, subject, however, to the reservation that, when a criminal court considers that proceedings ought to be instituted before itself, it may require the prescribed military authority to deliver over the offender or to postpone proceedings pending a reference to the Central Government.

It should be noted that the civil offences contained in Chapter VII of the Indian Penal Code (offences relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force), if committed by persons subject to AA are not triable by the civil power (IPC.s.139) and are therefore not timable by a court-martial under AA.s.69. Such an offence may, however, be tried by a court-martial if it amounts to a military offence or to some other civil offence triable under AA.s.69 and is so charged.

- 3. Principles on which jurisdiction should be exercised. —Though a wide power of trial by court-martial is given, it is not as a rule expedient to exercise the power universally.
Where troops are stationed at places having no competent civil (criminal) courts, it is necessary to try all offences committed by persons subject to AA by military tribunals.

But inside Indian territory where a competent civil court has been established it is, as a general rule, desirable to try by a civil (criminal) court a civil offence omitted by a person subject to AA if the offence is one which relates to the property or person of a civilian or is committed in conjunction with a civilian, or if the civil authorities intimate a desire to bring the case before a civil court.

The general rule is, however, subject to qualifications. The line dividing the military from the civil offence may be narrow. The offence may have been committed within the military lines. The offender may be one of a body of troops about to proceed on active service. There may be reasons making the prompt infliction of punishment expedient. In any such case it may be desirable to try the offence by court-martial.

There may be also considerations arising out of the importance of maintaining discipline. If offences of a particular kind, or offences generally, are rife in a unit or at a station, it may be necessary, for the sake of discipline, to try every offence, whether civil or military, by court-martial, so that the punishment may be prompt and in accordance with the requirements of discipline.

The heinousness of an offence is also an element for consideration. A trifling offence, such as would, if tried by a civil court, be properly punishable by a small fine, may well be punished by the military tribunal immediately, especially if the case is one in which stoppages may be ordered to make good damage occasioned by the offence. On the other hand, certain civil offences (e. g., complicated frauds) are not suitable for trial by court-martial and it would be better if they are relegated to the civil court as should also any case where intricate questions of law are likely to arise.

- 4. The Indian Penal Code. —Most of the civil offences, as defined in para I above and triable by courts-martial, are included in the Indian Penal Code, an Act which codifies the criminal law of India, but a few, e.g., the offences against the Official Secrets Act 1923, are created by special statutes. It should be noted that words and expressions defined in the Indian Penal Code have, when used in the AA (unless defined in that Act), the meaning attributed to them by that Code (AA.s.3(XXV)). Thus, wherever "theft'', "assault", or "house-breaking" are mentioned in the AA the offence so defined in the Indian Penal Code is intended. Also all the penal sections of the former Act are subject to the "general exceptions" of the latter. The Indian Penal Code has been reproduced in Part III of the Manual.

- 5. Scheme of the chapter. —The object of this chapter is to give some description of the civil offences which may come before courts-martial. The list is not exhaustive, but the more common offences have been treated in greater detail than those which experience shows rarely, if ever, to come within the cognizance of courts-martial.
Before proceeding to a description of. the various offences it will be convenient to discuss, first, the punishments which may be awarded, and, secondly, the general principles as to criminal responsibility, principles, it must be remembered, which are applicable to military not less than to civil offences.

- (i) Punishments

- 6. AA.s.69 specifies the punishments which may be awarded for civil offences charged under that section. If the offence is punishable under any law in force in with death or imprisonment for life, a court-martial is empowered

to award any punishment (other than whipping) assigned for the offence. by that law and such less punishment as is mentioned in AA. It should be note that in substitution for the punishment assigned by law creating the offence (e.g.,the IPC) a court-martial is empowered by AA.s.75 to award on active service field punishment to any person below the rank of WO and in addition to or in substitution for any such punishment, any one or more of the punishments specified in AA.s.73.

With regard to every other civil offence charged under AA.s.69, the effect of the section is to empower courts-martial to award imprisonment upto 7 years or such less punishment as is mentioned in the AA or the punishment (other than whipping) which under the civil law may be awarded for the offence.

Courts are, of course, subject to the limitation placed on their powers of punishment e.g., a DCM cannot award a higher punishment than two years imprisonment.

- 7. A comparison of the various punishments specified in the Indian Penal Code will be a guide to the court as to the heinousness of each offence in the eye of the law. It must be remembered that each punishment specified is a maximum and that, except in the case of offences for which an obligatory punishment is assigned (e.g., death or imprisonment for life for murder), any less punishment, if authorised, may be awarded by a court-martial for a civil offence, even if such punishment is not one which a civil court could have awarded, e.g., dismissal from the service. In awarding punishment for a civil offence a court-martial should be guided by exactly the same principles as those which guides it in punishing military offences.
- (ii) Responsibility for Crime

- 8. Every one responsible for natural consequences of his actions. — The general rule is that a person is responsible for the natural consequences of his acts. If, therefore, a person's acts, and the natural consequences which follow them, bring him within the penal provisions of the IPC, he is criminally responsible under that code, unless his case falls within one of the "general exceptions" (IPC chapter IV) or any special exception applicable to the particular offence. Thus, a person who kills another under circumstances which amount to murder as defined in the Code (IPC.s.300) is liable to the punishment assigned to that offence, but if he killed the other while himself in such a state of involuntary intoxication as would bring him within the terms of IPC.s.85, or in the lawful exercise of his right of private defence (general exceptions), he is excused, while if he did it under grave and sudden provocation (a special exception) his offence is reduced to culpable homicide.

- 9. Illegal omissions.—Words in the code, which refer to acts, also extend to illegal omissions (IPC.s.32), that is, omissions to do what a person is legally bound to do. The omission to do anything which one is not bound by law to do is not an offence: thus, if a man sees another drowning and is able to save him by holding out his hand, but omits to do so, even in the hope that the other may be drowned, still he is not criminally responsible. On the other hand, where the law imposes upon a person the duty of performing some particular act he is held responsible if he omits to do so. Every person who has charge of another, e.g., a child, a person of unsound mind, an invalid, or a prisoner, is bound to provide him with necessaries if he is so helpless as to be unable to provide himself, and if death results from a neglect of such duty, the person in charge will be responsible unless he can show some good excuse. So, in the case of an animal known to be dangerous, the person in charge is bound to take such precautions as will safeguard the public from danger.

10.Omission to perform duty—Similarly, if a person undertakes to do any act the omission of which may endanger human life (as for instance, warning persons from a range whilst firing is going on), and without lawful excuse omits to discharge that duty, he is responsible for the consequences. Again, if a person undertakes to administer surgical or medical treatment, or to do any other act which may be dangerous to human life, he is responsible if death results from a want of reasonable care and skill on his part. For instance, if a sepoy was to undertake to cut off the trigger finger of another sepoy and mortification set in, he would be responsible for the consequences of his act. In the class of cases referred to here, there would rarely be such intention or knowledge as would make the offence murder or culpable homicide under the IPC. It might often, however, amount to causing death by a rash or negligent act contrary to IPC.s.304A.

- 11. Parties to offence. —The responsibility of a person for the natural consequences of his act is not limited to the simple case where he is present, and actually commits an offence with his own hand.

- 12. Assisting offence, —Thus, the IPC provides that when a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each is liable or that act as if he had done it alone (IPC.s.34). If, therefore, two or three men go out to commit house-breaking and one waits at the corner of the street to keep watch while the others break into the house, the watcher will be guilty of house breaking equally with the others, though he never goes near the house. Further, when an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates by doing any one of those acts, commits that offence (IPC.s.37). If, therefore, in pursuance of a common intention to commit theft, A steals goods in a house and hands them to B who is waiting outside, and B, then carries them away, both are guilty of theft. On the other hand, if the offence charged involves some special intent, it must be shown that the assistant was cognisant of the intentions of the person whom he assisted (IPC.s.35); thus, since B in the last example knew of A's intention to steal, and waited outside the house to assist him, his offence was theft, but if he had been unaware of the intention till the goods were handed to him his offence would not have been theft but receiving stolen property.

13.Common intent. —If several persons combined together for an unlawful purpose or for a lawful purpose to be effected by unlawful means, each is responsible for every offence committed by any one of them in furtherance of that purpose but not for an offence committed by another member of the party which is unconnected with the common purpose unless he personally instigates or assists in its commission. Thus, if some of the party of house-breakers in the example given above are armed with revolvers and the others all know it, thus showing a common intention not only to break into the house but to carry out their criminal object there in spite of all resistance, and the owner is killed in defending his property, all the party, including even the watchers outside, are guilty of murder. But if two persons go out to commit theft and one, unknown to the other, puts a pistol in his pocket and shoots a man, the other is not responsible for the killing.

- 14. Abettor present when offence committed. —Another case in which a person incurs full responsibility for the act of another is when an abettor (see para 15 below) is present at the place when the act or offence he abets is committed (IPC.s.114). In this case, and in the cases referred to above, the person made responsible for the acts of another is deemed to be guilty of the actual offence committed and should be so charged, i.e., all the party in first example in para 12 should be charged with house-breaking, and, if murder results from the pursuit of their common intention (see para 13), with murder also. Similarly, if A instigates B to murder C (abetment) and A is present when B commits the murder, A is guilty of murder and should be so charged.

- 15. Abetment. —A person may make himself responsible for the crime of another by instigating, conspiring with, or intentionally aiding the actual criminal in one of the ways described in IPC ss.107 and 108. In such cases he cannot (except as already mentioned) be charged with the actual offence committed by the other, and must be charged with "abetting" that offence. The abetment of an offence is punishable under IPC.ss.109 to 117 and AA,ss.66 to 69.

- 16. Innocent agent. —It does not always follow that the person who commits the offence which is abetted is himself criminally responsible. Thus, if A instigates B (a child under seven years of age) (IPC.s.82) or a person in a state of involuntary intoxication (IPC.s.85) to murder C, and B does so, A has abetted the murder of C, but B has committed no offence. Similarly, if a sepoy knowing that a pair of boots do not belong to him, induces a comrade to steal them by representing that they are his property and not the property of the actual possessor, the former is guilty of abetting theft though the latter has committed no offence at all (IPC.s.108; illustration (d)).

17.Harboring offenders.—A person may incur criminal responsibility even after an offence has been committed by helping the offender to escape from justice, or by destroying the evidence of his guilt. This form of responsibility is provided for in the sections of the IPC which deal with harbouring and screening an offender (IPC.ss.136 and 212 to 2I6A). Persons who offend against these sections do not, however, make themselves, fully responsible for the original crime, as in the cases referred to in para 14 above, and cannot be so charged. The word "harbour" includes the supplying a person with shelter, food, drink, money, clothes, arms, ammunition, or means of conveyance, or the assisting a person in any way to evade apprehension (IPC.s.52A). The wife or husband of an offender is exempted from any penalty for harbouring that offender; an exception to this rule is, however, the harbouring of a State prisoner who has escaped (IPC.s.130 and exception to s. 216A).

- 18. Attempt to commit offence.- A person who attempts to commit an offence or to cause such an offence to be committed, and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence, is criminally responsible even though the attempt is unsuccessful (IPC.s.511: as to attempts to murder see s.307).
A mere intention to commit an offence unaccompanied by acts will not amount to an actual "attempt", nor will acts themselves if they are merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. For instance, if A, intending to murder B by poison, purchases poison and mixes it with food which remains in A's keeping, the mere mixing with food is not an attempt to murder by poison. Some act must be done which is more than an intention or preparation, and which is a real step towards the commission of the offence; thus, if A had placed the food on B's table, or delivered it to B's servants to place it on B's table, he would have been guilty of an attempt to murder.

It is no defence to a charge of attempting to commit a crime that it was legally or physically impossible for the offender to have committed the full offence e.g.,A with the intention of stealing B's wallet puts his hand in the latter's pocket but finds the pocket empty, will still be guilty of an attempt to commit theft.

Where a person is charged with committing an offence but the evidence shows merely an attempt to commit that offence, a court-martial may convict him of the attempt to commit the offence charged (see AA.s.139 (8)).

- (iii) Homicide

- 19. Culpable homicide. —Whoever causes the death of a human being by doing an act—
(a) with the intention of causing death, or

(b) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or

(c) with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death. commits at the least culpable homicide (IPC.s.299) and his act may amount to murder if certain further conditions as to his intention and knowledge are present. The intention or knowledge, express or implied, of the accused in such a case is therefore all important and it lies on the prosecution to show, by direct evidence or by inference from the facts of the case, that he had such intention or knowledge as is necessary to constitute the offence charged. In arriving at a decision upon this point a court will,however,presume that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts. This presumption will often arise in shooting cases or in other cases where death is caused with a lethal weapon.

- 20. Murder. —The kinds of intention or knowledge which will make culpable homicide amount to murder are set out in IPC.s.300. If these are compared with para19 above, it will be seen that, subject to certain exceptions which are considered in para21, culpable homicide of the first kind is always murder. Culpable homicide of the second kind is murder, if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury, as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Culpable homicide of the third kind is murder only if the person committing the act, which causes death, knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause either death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. See illustrations to IPC.s.300.

- 21. Exceptions.—Culpable homicide which would otherwise be murder is reduced to "culpable homicide not amounting to murder" in certain circumstances which are specified in the exceptions to IPC.s.300. Briefly these are—
(a) Grave and sudden provocation.

(b) Right of private defence exceeded.

(c) Powers of public servant exceeded.

(d) Sudden fight.

(e) Consent by the person killed.

The full text of these exceptions will be found in the IPC (Exceptions 1 to 5 to s.300) which should be consulted, but the first is the most frequently met with and demands more detailed notice.

- 22. Grave and sudden provocation. —It must be clearly established in all cases where grave and sudden provocation is put forward as an excuse that at the time when the crime was committed the offender was actually so completely under the influence of passion arising from the provocation that he was at that moment deprived of the power of self-control; and with this view it will be necessary to consider carefully the manner in which the crime was committed, the nature of the weapon used, the length of the interval between the provocation and the killing, the conduct of the offender during that interval, and all other circumstances tending to show his state of mind.

- 23. Subject to certain provisos. —This exception is further subject to three provisos—
(a) The provocation must not be sought by the person provoked. Thus, if A provokes B to strike him with the express purpose of providing himself with an excuse for killing B,and A kills B, the offence is murder.

(b) Provocation given by anything done in obedience to law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of his powers, does not reduce murder to culpable homicide. Thus a NCO lawfully arresting a sepoy may give great provocation to the latter, but if the arrest is lawful, the sepoy cannot successfully plead grave and sudden provocation if he kills the NCO.

(c) Provocation given in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence does not reduce murder to culpable homicide. For example, A, in defending himself, and his property from B who is trying to rob him, strikes B in the face with a whip. This so enrages B that he kills A. B cannot successfully plead grave and sudden provocation.

24.Culpable homicide of persons other than the one intended.—It will be noticed that the intention and knowledge referred to in para 19 are an intention to kill or vitially injure any one, and a knowledge that the death of any one is likely. Culpable homicide may, therefore, be committed by a person who intends to kill one man and kills another by mistake. In such a case the character of the culpable homicide is determined by what its character would have been if the person intended had been killed (IPC.s.301).

- 25. Burden of proof. —According to IEA the killing being established, the burden of showing such intention or knowledge as makes the crime murder or culpable homicide is still upon the prosecution (IEA.s.103). If, however, facts raising a presumption of such intention or knowledge (e.g., the nature of the weapon used) are shown to exist, such burden may be deemed to have been discharged. This killing and the requisite intention or knowledge being established, the burden is on the accused of showing that his case falls within any general or special exceptions (IEA.s.105); as for instance, by showing that he acted under a bona-fide mistake of fact and the fact (if true) would have excused him, or that he acted on grave and sudden provocation.

26.Penalty for murder. —The penalty for murder is death, or imprisonment for life (IPC.s.302). A court can, at its discretion, award either penalty, but must sentence the offender to one or the other. When a person already under sentence of imprisonment for life is convicted of murder the death sentence is obligatory (IPC.s.303).

- 27. Causing death by rash or negligent act. —Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act, not amounting to culpable homicide, may be punished with imprisonment extending to two years or with fine or both (IPC.s. 304A).
A person is criminally responsible for causing death, if he fails to take proper precautions when doing anything which is in its nature dangerous, even though he had not the least intention of bringing about the consequences of his act. It must be shown, in order to justify a conviction that the negligence from which death resulted was so gross and culpable and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime and to conduct deserving punishment.

Thus, if a sepoy fires his rifle without taking the proper precautions under the particular circumstances and the bullet kills a person, the sepoy will be criminally responsible for his death. Again, if a person points a gun at another in sport and pulls the trigger without proper precautions to ascertain, that the gun was unloaded, he will be responsible if death results, as the incident might clearly have been prevented if he had not been culpably negligent.

Rashness and negligence are not the same thing. Mere negligence cannot be construed to mean rashness. There are degrees of negligence and rashness and in order to be criminally liable the rashness must be of such a degree as to amount to taking hazard knowing that the hazard was of such a degree that injury was most likely to be occasioned thereby. The criminality lies in running the risk or doing such an act with recklessness and indifference to the consequences.

Other examples of this offence are: —Causing death by rash or negligent driving; and by negligently mixing a live round with blank cartridges.

Once it is proved that the death of the victim was a direct consequence of the rash or negligent act of the offender, the fact that the victim had contributed to his death by his own negligence, will not exonerate the offender; since the doctrine of contributory negligence does not apply to criminal liability when the death of a person is caused partly by the negligence of the offender and partly by his own negligence.

- (iv) Hurt and grievous hurt

28, "Hurt" and ''grievous hurt" defined. —Whoever causes bodily pain, disease, or infirmity to any person is said to cause "hurt" (IPC.s.319) and if that hurt is one of the graver kinds (specified in IPC.s.320) he is said to cause "grievous hurt". Whoever does an act with the intention of causing hurt to any one, or knowing that he is likely to cause hurt to any one, and does thereby cause hurt to the same or any other person, is said "voluntarily to cause hurt". If the hurt intended or known to be likely to be caused is grievous hurt and the hurt actually caused is grievous hurt (either of the same or a different kind) he is said "voluntarily to cause grievous hurt" (IPC.ss.321 and 322).

Voluntarily to cause hurt or grievous hurt to any one is an offence which varies in its gravity according to the instrument used, the provocation given, the status of the person hurt, and the object of the offender.

- (v) Criminal Force and Assault

- 29. "Force" defined. —The sections of the IPC which deal with these crimes are chiefly of interest to officers as defining the offences described in AA.ss.40(a) and 47. The definition of force in the IPC (IPC.s.349) is of a highly metaphysical nature but, for ordinary purposes, there is little difficulty in understanding what is meant by the application of force to a person, or through a thing to a person, and whoever intentionally uses force to a person without his consent, in order to commit an offence, or with an intention to cause injury, fear or annoyance, is said to use "criminal force'' (IPC.s.350). Whoever makes any gesture or preparation—
(a) intending to cause any one to apprehend that the person making the gesture, etc., is about to use criminal force to him, or

(b) knowing it to be likely that such gesture, etc., will cause such an apprehension, is said to commit an "assault" (IPC.s.351). Mere words cannot amount to an assault, but words accompanied by gestures or preparations may give the latter such a meaning as to amount to an assault.

- 30. Difference between assault and use of criminal force. —It will be noticed that if actual violence is done to a person, or attempted, an assault is not the proper description of the offence, which then becomes "using criminal force", or "attempting to use criminal force", as the case may be.
- (vi) Rape

- 31. Penetration,—Rape is defined in IPC,s.375. Penetration is sufficient to constitute such sexual intercourse as is there referred to; it must therefore be proved that there was actual penetration of the female organ by some part of the male organ. The slightest penetration will be sufficient; it is not necessary to prove that there was such penetration as would be sufficient to rupture the hymen. Whether there was an emission of semen or not is immaterial.
It is not an excuse that the woman was a common prostitute or the concubine of the ravisher, if the offence was committed by force or against her will; though proof of such facts is admissible, and is, of course, important in considering whether or not she is likely to have consented.

32.Consent, when valid.—A consideration of IPC.s.375 will show that the offence consists of sexual intercourse with a woman against her will, without her consent, or even with her consent when such consent has been obtained by putting her in fear of death or hurt, or by pretending to be her husband, or with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age; further, consent is not valid under the IPC when given by a person who from unsoundness of mind or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which she gives consent (IPC.s.90). Sexual intercourse with a woman who has, by drugs or liquor,

been reduced to such a condition as is indicated above, will therefore constitute rape.

- 33. Caution as to evidence in cases of alleged rape—A word of caution regarding charges for this offence is necessary. As Sir Matthew Hale, an eminent judge has said: "It is an accusation easily to be made, and hard to be proved, and harder to be defended by the party accused though never so innocent". Such charges are often brought from motives of revenge or blackmail, or to shield a reputation which has been voluntarily endangered. Courts should, therefore, examine and sift the evidence, especially that of the woman said to have been ravished, with the greatest care.

- 34. Attempted rape.—When the offence is incomplete for want of penetration the accused may be convicted of an attempt to commit rape, provided that the court is satisfied that it was his intention to gratify his passions at all events and notwithstanding any resistance. An indecent assault upon a woman does not amount to an attempt to commit rape, unless the court is satisfied that there was a determination in the accused to gratify his passions at all events and in spite of all resistance.
- (vii) Theft and Cognate Offences

- 35. Property which can be subject of theft.—Theft is defined in IPC.s.378. It can only be committed in respect of moveable property which is in the possession of some one.

- 36. Moveable property.—All corporeal property except land and things attached to it is moveable property (IPC.s.22). Things attached to the land may become moveable property by severance, and the act of severance may of itself be theft. The cutting down of a tree, with the intention of dishonestly removing it without the owner's consent, is thus theft (IPC.s.378, illustration (a)).

37.Property must be in possession of some one. —The property must be in the possession of some one, but it does not matter whether that possession is rightful or wrongful. A thing can be stolen from a thief who has himself stolen it, not less than from the rightful owner of the thing. A person cannot steal a thing which is in his own possession, or a thing which is not in the possession of any one. Wild animals (including game and fish) while at large, and not being in the possession of any one, cannot be the subject of theft, but if they have been tamed or are in confinement they can be stolen like any other property. When a man mislays property in his own house it still remains legally in his possession, and any one finding it is bound to assume that it belongs to him.

38.Possession through another. —Property in the possession of a person's wife, clerk or servant, on that person's account is in that person's possession within the meaning of the IPC (IPC.s.27)

The same principle also extends to other cases where a man's property is in the physical possession of some one to whom he has entrusted it and from whom he can demand it unconditionally when ever he pleases. Thus, where a servant has his master's plate in his keeping or a shepherd is in charge of his master's sheep; the legal possession remains with the master; similarly, the landlord of a hotel retains the legal possession of the forks and spoons which his customers are handling at the dinner table and a shop-keeper retains the legal possession of goods which a purchaser takes up in order to inspect them. The possession of anything by a servant on his master's behalf is thus considered to be the possession of the master or the possession of the servant according to the circumstances under which the servant originally received it. If, for instance, a servant is given the custody of anything by his master, or by a fellow-servant who has been given the custody of it by his master, the servant will have no real possession of the thing, and the possession will remain with the master. Therefore, any dishonest taking of the thing by the servant will be theft. If, however, a servant receives anything from a third person on his master's behalf, then the servant will have possession of the thing, and the master will have no possession until the servant does some act by which the possession is transferred from the servant to the master—as, for example, by placing it in a till, cart or godown, in which the master's goods are kept or carried.

39.What constitutes theft.—To constitute theft there must be—

(a) a dishonest intention to take the property out of the possession of its real or temporary owner (i.e.,he who has "possession" of it) without his consent, and

(b) a moving of the property in order to such taking (IPC.s.378).

The intention must be dishonest one, that is, an intention to cause wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another (IPC.s.24) and therefore inconsistent with a bonafide claim or right. If the property is taken under the supposition, honestly entertained, that the taker has an immediate right to possession, the intention is not dishonest and there is no theft; on the other hand, a person who has pawned his watch can steal the watch from the pawnbroker, because he has no right to possession until he has redeemed it. A claim of right would not justify a person in taking property out of another's possession without his consent with the intention of thereby coercing the other to pay a debt due to the taker. It must be remembered that consent is not valid if given under fear or misconception (IPC.s.90).

- 40. Moving.—In addition to the dishonest intention there must be a moving of the property in order to the taking of it. It is not necessary to prove that the goods were removed out of their owner's reach, or were carried away at all from the place in which they were found. Here all that is necessary is movement, and, that being proved, and the other ingredients of theft being present, the offence is complete.

41.Other allied offences.—Closely allied to theft are the offences of dishonest misappropriation and criminal breach of trust. These differ from theft in that, while theft is committed in respect of property in the possession of another, these two offences consist in dealing dishonestly with property which is innocently or lawfully in the possession of the offender. shop-keeper retains the legal possession of goods which a purchaser takes up in order to inspect them. The possession of anything by a servant on his master's behalf is thus considered to be the possession of the master or the possession of the servant according to the circumstances under which the servant originally received it. If, for instance, a servant is given the custody of anything by his master, or by a fellow-servant who has been given the custody of it by his master, the servant will have no real possession of the thing, and the possession will remain with the master. Therefore, any dishonest taking of the thing by the servant will be theft. If, however, a servant receives anything from a third person on his master's behalf, then the servant will have possession of the thing, and the master will have no possession until the servant does some act by which the possession is transferred from the servant to the master—as, for example, by placing it in a till, cart or godown, in which the master's goods are kept or carried.

##### CHAPTER VII

### DUTIES IN AID OF THE CIVIL POWER

- 1. Introduction. —The primary role of the regular Army is to defend the country against external aggression and troops are trained and equipped for such a task. The assistance of the armed forces (military, naval and air forces) (Cr. P.C.,1973 s. 132(3)) is however, sought by the civil government for various internal duties, both in peace and in war. The types of aid so sought by the civil government are as under: —
(a) maintenance of law and order;

(b) maintenance of essential services;

(c) assistance during natural and other calamities; and

(d)other types of assistance, including assistance in development projects.

above types of assistance. In its restricted meaning, it is to be applied to the aid given by the Army for the maintenance of law and order and this chapter mainly deals with various aspects of the same.

- 2. Maintenance of law and order. —The responsibility of maintaining law and order is primarily that of the State Governments. State Governments have adequate machinery at their disposal for the dispersal of unlawful assemblies, suppression of disturbances and riots and the maintenance of law and order generally, by arrest and punishment of offenders. Civil authorities are first required to utilise the civil forces at their disposal for restoring law and order, and seek the aid of the Army only when the civil forces are inadequate to deal with the situation (of this the civil authority is the judge). The causes for civil unrest and disturbances may be many but primarily they are due to labour dissatisfaction and industrial disputes, strikes organised by labour for redress of real or imaginary grievances, and disputes among religious sections and rival political parties.

- 3. Unlawful assembly and riot. —Before examining the nature and extent of aid required to be rendered by the Army for the maintenance of law and order, it would be useful to know the technical meaning of the terms "unlawful assembly" and "riot".
Unlawful assembly.—An assembly of five or more persons whose common object is to—

(a) overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the Central or any State Government or Parliament or the legislature of any State or any public servant in the exercise of his lawful power; or

(b) resist the execution of law, or any legal process; or

(c) commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence; or

(d) obtain possession of any property or to stop a right of way or to prevent lawful use of water or to enforce any right or supposed right against any person in enjoyment of such property or thing, by means of criminal force or show of criminal force; or

(e) compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do, by means of criminal force or show of criminal force.

An assembly which was not unlawful when it assembled may subsequently become an unlawful assembly (IPC.s.141),

A person who being aware of the facts which render an assembly unlawful intentionally joins it or continues in it is said to be a member of an unlawful assembly (IPC.s.142).

Riot. —Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, it becomes a riot (IPC.s.146).

- 4. Dispersal of unlawful assemblies. —The law governing the dispersal of unlawful assemblies is contained in Chapter X (ss. 129 to 132) of the Cr PC, 1973 (2 of 1973). Any executive magistrate or officer incharge of a police station or, in the absence of such officer in-charge, any police officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector may command any unlawful assembly or any assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace, to disperse; and it becomes the duty of every member of such an assembly to disperse accordingly (Cr PC, 1973. s. 129 (1)).

- 5. Use of force to disperse unlawful assemblies. —If, upon being so commanded, any such assembly does not disperse, or if, without being so commanded, it conducts itself in such a manner as to show a determination not to disperse, any executive magistrate or officer incharge of police station referred to in para 4 above, may proceed to disperse such assembly by force, and may require the assistance of any male civilian for the purpose of dispersing such assembly and, if necessary, for arresting and confining the persons who form part of it, in order to disperse such assembly or that they may be punished according to law (Cr PC, 1973. s. 129(2)).

6.When the civil authorities are incapable of dispersing such an unlawful assembly by the use of all the resources at their disposal, they can seek the aid of the armed forces, if it is necessary for the public security that such assembly should be dispersed. The executive magistrate of the highest rank who is present may cause it to be dispersed by the armed forces (Cr PC, 1973. s. 130(1)).

7.Duties of officer commanding troops to disperse unlawful assemblies. — When an executive magistrate decides to disperse any unlawful assembly by the armed forces, he may require any officer (as defined in Cr PC, 1973. s.132 (3)(b)) in command of any group of persons belonging to the armed forces to disperse such assembly with the help of armed forces under his command and to arrest and confine such persons forming part of it, as the magistrate may direct, or as it may be necessary to arrest and confine in order to disperse the assembly or to have them punished according to law (Cr PC, 1973. s. 130 (2)). Every officer of the armed forces is required to obey the requisition of the magistrate in such manner as he thinks fit but in doing so, he is to use as little force and do as little injury to person and property as may be consisent with dispersing the assembly and arresting and detaining such persons (Cr PC,1973.s.130(3)).

- 8. Principles governing use of force. —The use of force in dispersal of unlawful assemblies, is governed by the following principles: —
(a) Necessity—

- (i) There must be justification for each separate act;
- (ii) Action should not be taken in one place with the object of creating effect in another place;
- (iii) There should be no reprisals;
- (iv) Action should be preventive and not punitive.
The necessity is deemed to be established, when the executive magistrate requisitions the aid; or when an officer or JCO acts under circumstances stated in para 10 below, or a WO or OR acts under circumstances stated in para 12 below,

(b) Minimum force—

No more force is to be used than is necessary to achieve the immediate object. This refers to the actual amount of force used and not to the number of troops employed.

(c) Impartiality—

Officers and other persons must be impartial in communal disturbances or labour strikes. They should not accept gifts or show favours.

(d) Good faith—

Officers and other persons must act in good faith. Nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention (IPC.s.52).

- 9. Method of dispersal of unlawful assembly. —The actual use of troops for the dispersal of an unlawful assembly is the most difficult of all operations in aid of civil power. It is, therefore, imperative that all ranks fully understand its implications. Troops employed will not use police methods or be armed with police weapons like lathies and truncheons. They will use their own weapons and military tactics to deal with the situation. When fire is to be opened on a mob, the procedure should be as follows: —
(a) Before firing. —If possible the crowd should be warned that unless the unlawful assembly disperses, fire is to be opened and that it will be effective. The magistrate present should give this warning in vernacular, if he is able to do so. Attention of the crowd can be attracted by sounding a bugle or whistle. A warning notice in appropriate vernacular, where possible, should be carried and exposed to the mob at the required moment. The police force present at the spot does not come under the command of the officer commanding the body of troops. Troops should be kept out of sight of the mob, until they are to be actively used.

(b) During firing. —Firing will be controlled strictly. If officer commanding the body of troops considers that firing by a single or a few individuals is likely to prove sufficient, he will issue orders to one person of a few specified individuals. If more fire is required, he will issue orders to specified section commanders. While giving fire orders, he will indicate definite targets and state the number of rounds to be fired. The most effective targets are usually the ring leaders. Troops should shoot for effect. They should normally direct their fire low in order to injure and incapacitate rather than to kill. Firing with blank ammunition or over the heads of the crowd is strictly forbidden. Rapid fire should never be necessary except in self- defence. Pauses in firing will give the crowd an opportunity to disperse. Firing should be stopped immediately the crowd begins to disperse. It should be ensured that the mob does not get too close, to the troops, so as to hamper their tactical handling of weapons or to get involved into hand to hand fighting.

(c) After firing. —Immediate steps should be taken to succour the injured. Arrangements should be made for first-aid, medical attention, and evacuation of injured rioters to the hospital. All empty cases should be recovered and the number of rounds fired counted and recorded in a diary. Important witnesses to the incident should be detained with the help of the executive magistrate. All arrested rioters should be handed over to the civil authority for being dealt with in accordance with the law. It is absolutely essential that a minute to minute and item by item diary of events is maintained by the officer commanding the body of troops. Importance of this record cannot be over-emphasised, since in case of an inquiry about the firing, such a diary would be most useful.

- 10. Power of commissioned officers to disperse unlawful assemblies. —It may happen that when troops are called out for dispersing unlawful assemblies, an executive magistrate may not be present on the spot to handle the situation. In such cases when public security is manifestly endangered by such assembly and when no executive magistrate can be communicated with, any commissioned or gazetted officer of the armed forces may disperse such assembly with the help of the troops under his command and may arrest and confine any person forming part of it, in order to disperse such assembly or that they may be punished according to law. While so acting, the officer or JCO must, when it is practicable for him to do so, communicate with an executive magistrate, and thereafter obey the instructions of such magistrate, as to whether or not he should continue the action (Cr PC, 1973. s. 131). If the magistrate directs to cease action, such direction must be carried out. The use of force in such circumstances is also governed by the same principles enumerated in para 8 above.

- 11. Protection of officers and men acting in aid to civil power - No commissioned officer acting in good faith under circumstances referred to in para 10 above, no officer acting at the request of an executive magistrate under circumstances referred to para 7 above, no JCO, WO or OR acting in obedience to any order of his superior officer which he was bound to obey by law., is deemed to have committed any offence and no prosecution can be instituted in any civil (criminal) court against any such officer, JCO, WO or OR except with the sanction of the Central Government (Cr PC, 1973. s. 132).

- 12. Rights of WOs and OR to act in an emergency. — As stated above, in the absence of a magistrate, only a commissioned officer is competent to take action for dispersal of an unlawful assembly when public security is manifestly endangered and a WO or OR cannot do so on his own. However, a WO or OR can exercise the right of private defence of person or property (IPC.s.96), under the ordinary civil law to safeguard the lives of himself, the persons under his command and other persons and to protect any property against theft, robbery, mischief, or criminal trespass (IPC.ss.97 to 106).

- 13. Powers of WOs or OR to arrest rioters/members of unlawful assembly. —A WO or OR has no power to arrest on his own, any rioters or members of an unlawful assembly under the circumstances referred to in para 10 above. However, under the powers conferred on every citizen by civil law, a WO or OR can arrest any person, who, in his view, commits a nonbailable and cognizable offence or any proclaimed offender and hand him over to the police authorities without unnecesary delay (Cr PC,. 1973. s. 43). Offences of murder, culpable homicide, attempt to murder, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon, theft, robbery and docoity are nonbailable and cognizable offences. In making the arrest, when such person forcibly resists the endeavour to arrest him or attempts to evade the arrest, a WO or OR can use force but no more force is to be used than is necessary. In using force, under these circumstances, he has no right to cause the death of such person unless he is accused of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life (Cr PC, 1973. ss. 46and 49).

- 14. For other procedural details, see RA paras 301 to 303. For Cr PC provisions referred to above, see Part. 111.

- 15. Martial Law —Conditions of extreme disorder may sometimes arise when the civil authorities, even with the help of the armed forces, are unable to bring the situation under control. In such. cases Martial Law may be imposed in the disturbed area by a military commander Martial Law may also be imposed by a military commander when there is a complete breakdown of civil administration e.g., during an insurrection against the Government. Martial Law V is. thus. the exercise of the right of private defence by repelling force by force,

- 16. Establishment of Military Law. —Martial Law means the suppression of the civil authority, by military authority, whose sole object is to restore conditions, as expeditiously as possible, to enable the civil authority to resume charge. By imposing Martial Law a military commander assumes the appointment of Martial Law Administrator and takes control of the affected area. He may, however, require the civil authorities to discharge their normal functions under such conditions as may be prescribed by him. Being an extreme step, the decision to declare Martial Law has to be taken at the highest level possible. Before imposing Martial Law, as far as practicable, the military commander should obtain the approval of the Central Government. Where the situation is grave, and the circumstances are such that it is not possible to obtain the prior approval, of the Central Government the military commander may, on his own, assume supreme authority for the maintenance of law and order. He should, however, inform the Central Government as soon as possible after Martial Law is proclaimed. He -should also issue proclamation for the information of the inhabitants that Martial Law has been declared.

- 17. Martial Law Regulations, —Since the main object of imposition of martial Law is to restore law and order and the functioning of essential services vital to the community, the military commander should issue Martial Law Regulations, specifying therein the Martial Law offences, punishments for such offences, and constitute military courts for the trial of offenders against Martial Law.

- 18. Military courts. —Military courts under Martial Law are convened under the orders of the Administrator. One civil member having judicial experience should, if possible, be appointed to each court. These courts will deal with all offences including breaches of Martial Law Regulations.

- 19. Act of Indemnity. —When law and order has been restored, and civil authority resumes charge, civil courts may inquire into the legality of acts of military authorities while Martial Law was in force. For this reason it is necessary to protect persons who have been administering Martial Law, -from actions and prosecutions. This is done by an Act if Indemnity passed by the Parliament (Art 34 of the Constitution), Such an Act would make transactions legal which were illegal when they took place; free the individuals concerned from legal liability, and make the judgment of Military Courts valid, without which sentences passed by them could only be executed within the Martial Law areas and would automatically cease on the withdrawal of Martial Law. It is to be borne in mind that production is afforded under an Act of Indemnity only to those where acts were bonafide and performed in the honest belief that they were part of their duty.
